Log::Log4perl::FAQ \- Frequently Asked Questions on Log::Log4perl
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This \s-1FAQ\s0 shows a wide variety of 
commonly encountered logging tasks and how to solve them 
in the most elegant way with Log::Log4perl. Most of the time, this will
be just a matter of smartly configuring your Log::Log4perl configuration files.
.SS "Why use Log::Log4perl instead of any other logging module on \s-1CPAN\s0?"
.IX Subsection "Why use Log::Log4perl instead of any other logging module on CPAN?"
That's a good question. There's dozens of logging modules on \s-1CPAN\s0.
When it comes to logging, people typically think: \*(L"Aha. Writing out
debug and error messages. Debug is lower than error. Easy. I'm gonna
write my own.\*(R" Writing a logging module is like a rite of passage for
every Perl programmer, just like writing your own templating system.
.PP
Of course, after getting the basics right, features need to
be added. You'd like to write a timestamp with every message. Then
timestamps with microseconds. Then messages need to be written to both
the screen and a log file.
.PP
And, as your application grows in size you might wonder: Why doesn't
my logging system scale along with it? You would like to switch on
logging in selected parts of the application, and not all across the
board, because this kills performance. This is when people turn to
Log::Log4perl, because it handles all of that.
.PP
Avoid this costly switch.
.PP
Use \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl\*(C'\fR right from the start. \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl\*(C'\fR's \f(CW\*(C`:easy\*(C'\fR
mode supports easy logging in simple scripts:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&    Log::Log4perl\->easy_init($DEBUG);
\&
\&    DEBUG "A low\-level message";
\&    ERROR "Won\*(Aqt make it until level gets increased to ERROR";
.Ve
.PP
And when your application inevitably grows, your logging system grows
with it without you having to change any code.
.PP
Please, don't re-invent logging. \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl\*(C'\fR is here, it's easy
to use, it scales, and covers many areas you haven't thought of yet,
but will enter soon.
.SS "What's the easiest way to use Log4perl?"
.IX Subsection "What's the easiest way to use Log4perl?"
If you just want to get all the comfort of logging, without much
overhead, use \fIStealth Loggers\fR. If you use Log::Log4perl in 
\&\f(CW\*(C`:easy\*(C'\fR mode like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
.Ve
.PP
you'll have the following functions available in the current package:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    DEBUG("message");
\&    INFO("message");
\&    WARN("message");
\&    ERROR("message");
\&    FATAL("message");
.Ve
.PP
Just make sure that every package of your code where you're using them in
pulls in \f(CW\*(C`use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy)\*(C'\fR first, then you're set.
Every stealth logger's category will be equivalent to the name of the
package it's located in.
.PP
These stealth loggers
will be absolutely silent until you initialize Log::Log4perl in 
your main program with either
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        # Define any Log4perl behaviour
\&    Log::Log4perl\->init("foo.conf");
.Ve
.PP
(using a full-blown Log4perl config file) or the super-easy method
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        # Just log to STDERR
\&    Log::Log4perl\->easy_init($DEBUG);
.Ve
.PP
or the parameter-style method with a complexity somewhat in between:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        # Append to a log file
\&    Log::Log4perl\->easy_init( { level   => $DEBUG,
\&                                file    => ">>test.log" } );
.Ve
.PP
For more info, please check out \*(L"Stealth Loggers\*(R" in Log::Log4perl.
.SS "How can I simply log all my \s-1ERROR\s0 messages to a file?"
.IX Subsection "How can I simply log all my ERROR messages to a file?"
After pulling in the \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl\*(C'\fR module, just initialize its
behaviour by passing in a configuration to its \f(CW\*(C`init\*(C'\fR method as a string
reference. Then, obtain a logger instance and write out a message
with its \f(CW\*(C`error()\*(C'\fR method:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger);
\&
\&        # Define configuration
\&    my $conf = q(
\&        log4perl.logger                    = ERROR, FileApp
\&        log4perl.appender.FileApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
\&        log4perl.appender.FileApp.filename = test.log
\&        log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout   = PatternLayout
\&        log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout.ConversionPattern = %d> %m%n
\&    );
\&
\&        # Initialize logging behaviour
\&    Log::Log4perl\->init( \e$conf );
\&
\&        # Obtain a logger instance
\&    my $logger = get_logger("Bar::Twix");
\&    $logger\->error("Oh my, a dreadful error!");
\&    $logger\->warn("Oh my, a dreadful warning!");
.Ve
.PP
This will append something like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    2002/10/29 20:11:55> Oh my, a dreadful error!
.Ve
.PP
to the log file \f(CW\*(C`test.log\*(C'\fR. How does this all work?
.PP
While the Log::Log4perl \f(CW\*(C`init()\*(C'\fR method typically 
takes the name of a configuration file as its input parameter like
in
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Log::Log4perl\->init( "/path/mylog.conf" );
.Ve
.PP
the example above shows how to pass in a configuration as text in a 
scalar reference.
.PP
The configuration as shown
defines a logger of the root category, which has an appender of type 
\&\f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl::Appender::File\*(C'\fR attached. The line
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.logger = ERROR, FileApp
.Ve
.PP
doesn't list a category, defining a root logger. Compare that with
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.logger.Bar.Twix = ERROR, FileApp
.Ve
.PP
which would define a logger for the category \f(CW\*(C`Bar::Twix\*(C'\fR,
showing probably different behaviour. \f(CW\*(C`FileApp\*(C'\fR on
the right side of the assignment is
an arbitrarily defined variable name, which is only used to somehow 
reference an appender defined later on.
.PP
Appender settings in the configuration are defined as follows:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.filename = test.log
.Ve
.PP
It selects the file appender of the \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl::Appender\*(C'\fR
hierarchy, which will append to the file \f(CW\*(C`test.log\*(C'\fR if it already
exists. If we wanted to overwrite a potentially existing file, we would
have to explicitly set the appropriate \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl::Appender::File\*(C'\fR
parameter \f(CW\*(C`mode\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.filename = test.log
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.mode     = write
.Ve
.PP
Also, the configuration defines a PatternLayout format, adding
the nicely formatted current date and time, an arrow (>) and
a space before the messages, which is then followed by a newline:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout   = PatternLayout
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout.ConversionPattern = %d> %m%n
.Ve
.PP
Obtaining a logger instance and actually logging something is typically
done in a different system part as the Log::Log4perl initialisation section,
but in this example, it's just done right after init for the 
sake of compactness:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        # Obtain a logger instance
\&    my $logger = get_logger("Bar::Twix");
\&    $logger\->error("Oh my, a dreadful error!");
.Ve
.PP
This retrieves an instance of the logger of the category \f(CW\*(C`Bar::Twix\*(C'\fR, 
which, as all other categories, inherits behaviour from the root logger if no
other loggers are defined in the initialization section.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`error()\*(C'\fR
method fires up a message, which the root logger catches. Its
priority is equal to
or higher than the root logger's priority (\s-1ERROR\s0), which causes the root logger
to forward it to its attached appender. By contrast, the following
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $logger\->warn("Oh my, a dreadful warning!");
.Ve
.PP
doesn't make it through, because the root logger sports a higher setting
(\s-1ERROR\s0 and up) than the \s-1WARN\s0 priority of the message.
.SS "How can I install Log::Log4perl on Microsoft Windows?"
.IX Subsection "How can I install Log::Log4perl on Microsoft Windows?"
Log::Log4perl is fully supported on the Win32 platform. It has been tested 
with Activestate perl 5.6.1 under Windows 98 and rumor has it that it
also runs smoothly on all other major flavors (Windows \s-1NT\s0, 2000, \s-1XP\s0, etc.).
.PP
It also runs nicely with ActiveState 5.8.0, and, believe me, 
we had to jump through some major hoops for that.
.PP
Typically, Win32 systems don't have the \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR utility installed,
so the standard \f(CW\*(C`perl Makefile.PL; make install\*(C'\fR on the downloadable
distribution won't work. But don't despair, there's a very easy solution!
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl\*(C'\fR homepage provides a so-called \s-1PPD\s0 file for ActiveState's
\&\f(CW\*(C`ppm\*(C'\fR installer, which comes with ActiveState perl by default.
.IP "Install on ActiveState 5.6.*" 4
.IX Item "Install on ActiveState 5.6.*"
The \s-1DOS\s0 command line
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ppm install "http://log4perl.sourceforge.net/ppm/Log\-Log4perl.ppd"
.Ve
.Sp
will contact the Log4perl homepage, download the latest
\&\f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl\*(C'\fR
distribution and install it. If your ActiveState installation
lacks any of the modules \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl\*(C'\fR depends upon, \f(CW\*(C`ppm\*(C'\fR will 
automatically contact ActivateState and download them from their CPAN-like
repository.
.IP "Install on ActiveState 5.8.*" 4
.IX Item "Install on ActiveState 5.8.*"
ActiveState's \*(L"Programmer's Package Manager\*(R" can be called from
Window's Start Menu:
Start\->Programs\->>ActiveState ActivePerl 5.8>Perl Package Manager
will invoke ppm. Since Log::Log4perl hasn't made it yet into the standard
ActiveState repository (and you probably don't want their outdated packages
anyway), just tell ppm the first time you call it to add the Log4perl 
repository
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ppm> repository add http://log4perl.sourceforge.net/ppm
.Ve
.Sp
Then, just tell it to install Log::Log4perl and it will resolve all
dependencies automatically and fetch them from log4perl.sourceforge.net
if it can't find them in the main archives:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ppm> install Log\-Log4perl
.Ve
.PP
That's it! Afterwards, just create a Perl script like
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&    Log::Log4perl\->easy_init($DEBUG);
\&
\&    my $logger = get_logger("Twix::Bar");
\&    $logger\->debug("Watch me!");
.Ve
.PP
and run it. It should print something like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    2002/11/06 01:22:05 Watch me!
.Ve
.PP
If you find that something doesn't work, please let us know at
log4perl\-devel@lists.sourceforge.net \*(-- we'll apprechiate it. Have fun!
.SS "How can I include global (thread-specific) data in my log messages?"
.IX Subsection "How can I include global (thread-specific) data in my log messages?"
Say, you're writing a web application and want all your
log messages to include the current client's \s-1IP\s0 address. Most certainly,
you don't want to include it in each and every log message like in
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $logger\->debug( $r\->connection\->remote_ip,
\&                    " Retrieving user data from DB" );
.Ve
.PP
do you? Instead, you want to set it in a global data structure and
have Log::Log4perl include it automatically via a PatternLayout setting
in the configuration file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout.ConversionPattern = %X{ip} %m%n
.Ve
.PP
The conversion specifier \f(CW%X{ip}\fR references an entry under the key
\&\f(CW\*(C`ip\*(C'\fR in the global \f(CW\*(C`MDC\*(C'\fR (mapped diagnostic context) table, which 
you've set once via
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Log::Log4perl::MDC\->put("ip", $r\->connection\->remote_ip);
.Ve
.PP
at the start of the request handler. Note that this is a
\&\fIstatic\fR (class) method, there's no logger object involved.
You can use this method with as many key/value pairs as you like as long
as you reference them under different names.
.PP
The mappings are stored in a global hash table within Log::Log4perl.
Luckily, because the thread
model in 5.8.0 doesn't share global variables between threads unless
they're explicitly marked as such, there's no problem with multi-threaded
environments.
.PP
For more details on the \s-1MDC\s0, please refer to 
\&\*(L"Mapped Diagnostic Context (\s-1MDC\s0)\*(R" in Log::Log4perl and
Log::Log4perl::MDC.
.SS "My application is already logging to a file. How can I duplicate all messages to also go to the screen?"
.IX Subsection "My application is already logging to a file. How can I duplicate all messages to also go to the screen?"
Assuming that you already have a Log4perl configuration file like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.logger                    = DEBUG, FileApp
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.filename = test.log
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout   = PatternLayout
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout.ConversionPattern = %d> %m%n
.Ve
.PP
and log statements all over your code,
it's very easy with Log4perl to have the same messages both printed to
the logfile and the screen. No reason to change your code, of course, 
just add another appender to the configuration file and you're done:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.logger                    = DEBUG, FileApp, ScreenApp
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.filename = test.log
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout   = PatternLayout
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout.ConversionPattern = %d> %m%n
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.ScreenApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
\&    log4perl.appender.ScreenApp.stderr   = 0
\&    log4perl.appender.ScreenApp.layout   = PatternLayout
\&    log4perl.appender.ScreenApp.layout.ConversionPattern = %d> %m%n
.Ve
.PP
The configuration file above is assuming that both appenders are
active in the same logger hierarchy, in this case the \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR category.
But even if you've got file loggers defined in several parts of your system,
belonging to different logger categories,
each logging to different files, you can gobble up all logged messages
by defining a root logger with a screen appender, which would duplicate 
messages from all your file loggers to the screen due to Log4perl's 
appender inheritance. Check
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/09/11/log4perl.html
.Ve
.PP
for details. Have fun!
.SS "How can I make sure my application logs a message when it dies unexpectedly?"
.IX Subsection "How can I make sure my application logs a message when it dies unexpectedly?"
Whenever you encounter a fatal error in your application, instead of saying
something like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    open FILE, "<blah" or die "Can\*(Aqt open blah \-\- bailing out!";
.Ve
.PP
just use Log::Log4perl's fatal functions instead:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $log = get_logger("Some::Package");
\&    open FILE, "<blah" or $log\->logdie("Can\*(Aqt open blah \-\- bailing out!");
.Ve
.PP
This will both log the message with priority \s-1FATAL\s0 according to your current
Log::Log4perl configuration and then call Perl's \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR 
afterwards to terminate the program. It works the same with 
stealth loggers (see \*(L"Stealth Loggers\*(R" in Log::Log4perl), 
all you need to do is call
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&    open FILE, "<blah" or LOGDIE "Can\*(Aqt open blah \-\- bailing out!";
.Ve
.PP
What can you do if you're using some library which doesn't use Log::Log4perl
and calls \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR internally if something goes wrong? Use a
\&\f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR pseudo signal handler
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger);
\&
\&    $SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_} = sub {
\&        if($^S) {
\&            # We\*(Aqre in an eval {} and don\*(Aqt want log
\&            # this message but catch it later
\&            return;
\&        }
\&        local $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth =
\&              $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth + 1;
\&        my $logger = get_logger("");
\&        $logger\->fatal(@_);
\&        die @_; # Now terminate really
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
This will catch every \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR\-Exception of your
application or the modules it uses. In case you want to 
It
will fetch a root logger and pass on the \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR\-Message to it.
If you make sure you've configured with a root logger like this:
.PP

in the pseudo signal handler above merits a more detailed explanation. With
the setup above, if a module calls \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR in one of its functions, 
the fatal message will be logged in the signal handler and not in the
original function \*(-- which will cause the \f(CW%F\fR, \f(CW%L\fR and \f(CW%M\fR placeholders
in the pattern layout to be replaced by the filename, the line number
and the function/method name of the signal handler, not the error-throwing
module. To adjust this, Log::Log4perl has the \f(CW$caller_depth\fR variable, 
which defaults to 0, but can be set to positive integer values
to offset the caller level. Increasing
it by one will cause it to log the calling function's parameters, not
the ones of the signal handler. 
See \*(L"Using Log::Log4perl from wrapper classes\*(R" in Log::Log4perl for more
details.
.SS "How can I hook up the \s-1LWP\s0 library with Log::Log4perl?"
.IX Subsection "How can I hook up the LWP library with Log::Log4perl?"
Or, to put it more generally: How can you utilize a third-party
library's embedded logging and debug statements in Log::Log4perl? 
How can you make them print
to configurable appenders, turn them on and off, just as if they 
were regular Log::Log4perl logging statements?
.PP
The easiest solution is to map the third-party library logging statements
to Log::Log4perl's stealth loggers via a typeglob assignment.
.PP
As an example, let's take \s-1LWP\s0, one of the most popular Perl modules, 
which makes handling \s-1WWW\s0 requests and responses a breeze.
Internally, \s-1LWP\s0 uses its own logging and debugging system, 
utilizing the following calls 
inside the \s-1LWP\s0 code (from the LWP::Debug man page):
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        # Function tracing
\&    LWP::Debug::trace(\*(Aqsend()\*(Aq);
\&
\&        # High\-granular state in functions
\&    LWP::Debug::debug(\*(Aqurl ok\*(Aq);
\&
\&        # Data going over the wire
\&    LWP::Debug::conns("read $n bytes: $data");
.Ve
.PP
First, let's assign Log::Log4perl priorities 
to these functions: I'd suggest that
\&\f(CW\*(C`debug()\*(C'\fR messages have priority \f(CW\*(C`INFO\*(C'\fR, 
\&\f(CW\*(C`trace()\*(C'\fR uses \f(CW\*(C`DEBUG\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`conns()\*(C'\fR also logs with \f(CW\*(C`DEBUG\*(C'\fR \*(-- 
although your mileage may certainly vary.
.PP
Now, in order to transpartently hook up LWP::Debug with Log::Log4perl,
all we have to do is say
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package LWP::Debug;
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&
\&    *trace = *INFO;
\&    *conns = *DEBUG;
\&    *debug = *DEBUG;
\&
\&    package main;
\&    # ... go on with your regular program ...
.Ve
.PP
at the beginning of our program. In this way, every time the, say, 
\&\f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR module calls \f(CW\*(C`LWP::Debug::trace()\*(C'\fR, it will implicitely 
call \s-1\fIINFO\s0()\fR, which is the \f(CW\*(C`info()\*(C'\fR method of a stealth logger defined for
the Log::Log4perl category \f(CW\*(C`LWP::Debug\*(C'\fR. Is this cool or what?
.PP
Here's a complete program:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use LWP::UserAgent;
\&    use HTTP::Request::Common;
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&
\&    Log::Log4perl\->easy_init(
\&        { category => "LWP::Debug",
\&          level    => $DEBUG,
\&          layout   => "%r %p %M\-%L %m%n",
\&        });
\&
\&    package LWP::Debug;
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&    *trace = *INFO;
\&    *conns = *DEBUG;
\&    *debug = *DEBUG;
\&
\&    package main;
\&    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent\->new();
\&    my $resp = $ua\->request(GET "http://amazon.com");
\&
\&    if($resp\->is_success()) {
\&        print "Success: Received ", 
\&              length($resp\->content()), "\en";
\&    } else {
\&        print "Error: ", $resp\->code(), "\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
This will generate the following output on \s-1STDERR:\s0
.PP
.Vb 10

.Ve
.PP
Of course, in this way, the embedded logging and debug statements within
\&\s-1LWP\s0 can be utilized in any Log::Log4perl way you can think of. You can
have them sent to different appenders, block them based on the
category and everything else Log::Log4perl has to offer.
.PP
Only drawback of this method: Steering logging behaviour via category 
is always based on the \f(CW\*(C`LWP::Debug\*(C'\fR package. Although the logging
statements reflect the package name of the issuing module properly, 
the stealth loggers in \f(CW\*(C`LWP::Debug\*(C'\fR are all of the category \f(CW\*(C`LWP::Debug\*(C'\fR.
This implies that you can't control the logging behaviour based on the
package that's \fIinitiating\fR a log request (e.g. LWP::UserAgent) but only
based on the package that's actually \fIexecuting\fR the logging statement, 
\&\f(CW\*(C`LWP::Debug\*(C'\fR in this case.
.PP
To work around this conundrum, we need to write a wrapper function and
plant it into the \f(CW\*(C`LWP::Debug\*(C'\fR package. It will determine the caller and
create a logger bound to a category with the same name as the caller's
package:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    package LWP::Debug;
\&
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:levels get_logger);
\&
\&    sub l4p_wrapper {
\&        my($prio, @message) = @_;
\&        $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth += 2;
\&        get_logger(scalar caller(1))\->log($prio, @message);
\&        $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth \-= 2;
\&    }
\&
\&    no warnings \*(Aqredefine\*(Aq;
\&    *trace = sub { l4p_wrapper($INFO, @_); };
\&    *debug = *conns = sub { l4p_wrapper($DEBUG, @_); };
\&
\&    package main;
\&    # ... go on with your main program ...
.Ve
.PP
This is less performant than the previous approach, because every
log request will request a reference to a logger first, then call
the wrapper, which will in turn call the appropriate log function.
.PP
This hierarchy shift has to be compensated for by increasing
\&\f(CW$Log::Log4perl::caller_depth\fR by 2 before calling the log function
and decreasing it by 2 right afterwards. Also, the \f(CW\*(C`l4p_wrapper\*(C'\fR
function shown above calls \f(CWcaller(1)\fR which determines the name
of the package \fItwo\fR levels down the calling hierarchy (and 
therefore compensates for both the wrapper function and the
anonymous subroutine calling it).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`no warnings \*(Aqredefine\*(Aq\*(C'\fR suppresses a warning Perl would generate
otherwise
upon redefining \f(CW\*(C`LWP::Debug\*(C'\fR's \f(CW\*(C`trace()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`debug()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`conns()\*(C'\fR
functions. In case you use a perl prior to 5.6.x, you need
to manipulate \f(CW$^W\fR instead.
.PP
To make things easy for you when dealing with \s-1LWP\s0, Log::Log4perl 0.47 
introduces \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl\->infiltrate_lwp()\*(C'\fR which does exactly the
above.
.SS "What if I need dynamic values in a static Log4perl configuration file?"
.IX Subsection "What if I need dynamic values in a static Log4perl configuration file?"
Say, your application uses Log::Log4perl for logging and 
therefore comes with a Log4perl configuration file, specifying the logging
behaviour.
But, you also want it to take command line parameters to set values
like the name of the log file.
How can you have
both a static Log4perl configuration file and a dynamic command line
interface?
.PP
As of Log::Log4perl 0.28, every value in the configuration file
can be specified as a \fIPerl hook\fR. So, instead of saying
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename = test.log
.Ve
.PP
you could just as well have a Perl subroutine deliver the value
dynamically:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename = sub { logfile(); };
.Ve
.PP
given that \f(CW\*(C`logfile()\*(C'\fR is a valid function in your \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR package
returning a string containing the path to the log file.
.PP
Or, think about using the value of an environment variable:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.appender.DBI.user = sub { $ENV{USERNAME} };
.Ve
.PP
When \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl\->init()\*(C'\fR parses the configuration
file, it will notice the assignment above because of its
\&\f(CW\*(C`sub {...}\*(C'\fR pattern and treat it in a special way:
It will evaluate the subroutine (which can contain
arbitrary Perl code) and take its return value as the right side
of the assignment.
.PP
A typical application would be called like this on the command line:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    app                # log file is "test.log"
\&    app \-l mylog.txt   # log file is "mylog.txt"
.Ve
.PP
Here's some sample code implementing the command line interface above:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger);
\&    use Getopt::Std;
\&
\&    getopt(\*(Aql:\*(Aq, \eour %OPTS);
\&
\&    my $conf = q(
\&    log4perl.category.Bar.Twix         = WARN, Logfile
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename = sub { logfile(); };
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.layout   = SimpleLayout
\&    );
\&
\&    Log::Log4perl::init(\e$conf);
\&
\&    my $logger = get_logger("Bar::Twix");
\&    $logger\->error("Blah");
\&
\&    ###########################################
\&    sub logfile {
\&    ###########################################
\&        if(exists $OPTS{l}) {
\&            return $OPTS{l};
\&        } else {
\&            return "test.log";
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Every Perl hook may contain arbitrary perl code,
just make sure to fully qualify eventual variable names
(e.g. \f(CW%main::OPTS\fR instead of \f(CW%OPTS\fR).
.PP
\&\fB\s-1SECURITY\s0 \s-1NOTE\s0\fR: this feature means arbitrary perl code
can be embedded in the config file.  In the rare case
where the people who have access to your config file
are different from the people who write your code and
shouldn't have execute rights, you might want to call
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $Log::Log4perl::Config\->allow_code(0);
.Ve
.PP
before you call \fIinit()\fR. This will prevent Log::Log4perl from
executing \fIany\fR Perl code in the config file (including
code for custom conversion specifiers 
(see \*(L"Custom cspecs\*(R" in Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout).
.SS "How can I roll over my logfiles automatically at midnight?"
.IX Subsection "How can I roll over my logfiles automatically at midnight?"
Long-running applications tend to produce ever-increasing logfiles.
For backup and cleanup purposes, however, it is often desirable to move
the current logfile to a different location from time to time and
start writing a new one.
.PP
This is a non-trivial task, because it has to happen in sync with 
the logging system in order not to lose any messages in the process.
.PP
Luckily, \fIMark Pfeiffer\fR's \f(CW\*(C`Log::Dispatch::FileRotate\*(C'\fR appender
works well with Log::Log4perl to rotate your logfiles in a variety of ways.
.PP
Note, however, that having the application deal with rotating a log
file is not cheap. Among other things, it requires locking the log file 
with every write to avoid race conditions.
There are good reasons to use external rotators like \f(CW\*(C`newsyslog\*(C'\fR
instead.
See the entry \f(CW\*(C`How can I rotate a logfile with newsyslog?\*(C'\fR in the
\&\s-1FAQ\s0 for more information on how to configure it.
.PP
When using \f(CW\*(C`Log::Dispatch::FileRotate\*(C'\fR, 
all you have to do is specify it in your Log::Log4perl configuration file
and your logfiles will be rotated automatically.
.PP
You can choose between rolling based on a maximum size (\*(L"roll if greater
than 10 \s-1MB\s0\*(R") or based on a date pattern (\*(L"roll everyday at midnight\*(R").
In both cases, \f(CW\*(C`Log::Dispatch::FileRotate\*(C'\fR allows you to define a 
number \f(CW\*(C`max\*(C'\fR of saved files to keep around until it starts overwriting
the oldest ones. If you set the \f(CW\*(C`max\*(C'\fR parameter to 2 and the name of
your logfile is \f(CW\*(C`test.log\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Log::Dispatch::FileRotate\*(C'\fR will
move \f(CW\*(C`test.log\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`test.log.1\*(C'\fR on the first rollover. On the second
rollover, it will move \f(CW\*(C`test.log.1\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`test.log.2\*(C'\fR and then \f(CW\*(C`test.log\*(C'\fR
to \f(CW\*(C`test.log.1\*(C'\fR. On the third rollover, it will move \f(CW\*(C`test.log.1\*(C'\fR to 
\&\f(CW\*(C`test.log.2\*(C'\fR (therefore discarding the old \f(CW\*(C`test.log.2\*(C'\fR) and 
\&\f(CW\*(C`test.log\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`test.log.1\*(C'\fR. And so forth. This way, there's always 
going to be a maximum of 2 saved log files around.
.PP
Here's an example of a Log::Log4perl configuration file, defining a
daily rollover at midnight (date pattern \f(CW\*(C`yyyy\-MM\-dd\*(C'\fR), keeping
a maximum of 5 saved logfiles around:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    log4perl.category         = WARN, Logfile
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile = Log::Dispatch::FileRotate

\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.max         = 5
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.DatePattern = yyyy\-MM\-dd

.SS "What's the easiest way to turn off all logging, even with a lengthy Log4perl configuration file?"
.IX Subsection "What's the easiest way to turn off all logging, even with a lengthy Log4perl configuration file?"
In addition to category-based levels and appender thresholds,
Log::Log4perl supports system-wide logging thresholds. This is the 
minimum level the system will require of any logging events in order for them 
to make it through to any configured appenders.
.PP
For example, putting the line
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.threshold = ERROR
.Ve
.PP
anywhere in your configuration file will limit any output to any appender
to events with priority of \s-1ERROR\s0 or higher (\s-1ERROR\s0 or \s-1FATAL\s0 that is).
.PP
However, in order to suppress all logging entirely, you need to use a
priority that's higher than \s-1FATAL:\s0 It is simply called \f(CW\*(C`OFF\*(C'\fR, and it is never
used by any logger. By definition, it is higher than the highest 
defined logger level.
.PP
Therefore, if you keep the line
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.threshold = OFF
.Ve
.PP
somewhere in your Log::Log4perl configuration, the system will be quiet
as a graveyard. If you deactivate the line (e.g. by commenting it out), 
the system will, upon config reload, snap back to normal operation, providing 
logging messages according to the rest of the configuration file again.
.SS "I keep getting duplicate log messages! What's wrong?"
.IX Subsection "I keep getting duplicate log messages! What's wrong?"
Having several settings for related categories in the Log4perl 
configuration file sometimes leads to a phenomenon called 
\&\*(L"message duplication\*(R". It can be very confusing at first,
but if thought through properly, it turns out that Log4perl behaves
as advertised. But, don't despair, of course there's a number of 
ways to avoid message duplication in your logs.
.PP
Here's a sample Log4perl configuration file that produces the
phenomenon:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    log4perl.logger.Cat        = ERROR, Screen
\&    log4perl.logger.Cat.Subcat = WARN, Screen
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.Screen   = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
\&    log4perl.appender.Screen.layout = SimpleLayout
.Ve
.PP
It defines two loggers, one for category \f(CW\*(C`Cat\*(C'\fR and one for
\&\f(CW\*(C`Cat::Subcat\*(C'\fR, which is obviously a subcategory of \f(CW\*(C`Cat\*(C'\fR.
The parent logger has a priority setting of \s-1ERROR\s0, the child
is set to the lower \f(CW\*(C`WARN\*(C'\fR level.
.PP
Now imagine the following code in your program:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $logger = get_logger("Cat.Subcat");
\&    $logger\->warn("Warning!");
.Ve
.PP
What do you think will happen? An unexperienced Log4perl user
might think: "Well, the message is being sent with level \s-1WARN\s0, so the 
\&\f(CW\*(C`Cat::Subcat\*(C'\fR logger will accept it and forward it to the 
attached \f(CW\*(C`Screen\*(C'\fR appender. Then, the message will percolate up 
the logger hierarchy, find
the \f(CW\*(C`Cat\*(C'\fR logger, which will suppress the message because of its
\&\s-1ERROR\s0 setting."
But, perhaps surprisingly, what you'll get with the
code snippet above is not one but two log messages written 
to the screen:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    WARN \- Warning!
\&    WARN \- Warning!
.Ve
.PP
What happened? The culprit is that once the logger \f(CW\*(C`Cat::Subcat\*(C'\fR 
decides to fire, it will forward the message \fIunconditionally\fR 
to all directly or indirectly attached appenders. The \f(CW\*(C`Cat\*(C'\fR logger 
will never be asked if it wants the message or not \*(-- the message 
will just be pushed through to the appender attached to \f(CW\*(C`Cat\*(C'\fR.
.PP
One way to prevent the message from bubbling up the logger
hierarchy is to set the \f(CW\*(C`additivity\*(C'\fR flag of the subordinate logger to
\&\f(CW0\fR:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    log4perl.logger.Cat            = ERROR, Screen
\&    log4perl.logger.Cat.Subcat     = WARN, Screen
\&    log4perl.additivity.Cat.Subcat = 0
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.Screen   = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
\&    log4perl.appender.Screen.layout = SimpleLayout
.Ve
.PP
The message will now be accepted by the \f(CW\*(C`Cat::Subcat\*(C'\fR logger,
forwarded to its appender, but then \f(CW\*(C`Cat::Subcat\*(C'\fR will suppress
any further action. While this setting avoids duplicate messages
as seen before, it is often not the desired behaviour. Messages
percolating up the hierarchy are a useful Log4perl feature.
.PP
If you're defining \fIdifferent\fR appenders for the two loggers,
one other option is to define an appender threshold for the
higher-level appender. Typically it is set to be 
equal to the logger's level setting:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    log4perl.logger.Cat           = ERROR, Screen1
\&    log4perl.logger.Cat.Subcat    = WARN, Screen2
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.Screen1   = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
\&    log4perl.appender.Screen1.layout = SimpleLayout
\&    log4perl.appender.Screen1.Threshold = ERROR
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.Screen2   = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
\&    log4perl.appender.Screen2.layout = SimpleLayout
.Ve
.PP
Since the \f(CW\*(C`Screen1\*(C'\fR appender now blocks every message with
a priority less than \s-1ERROR\s0, even if the logger in charge
lets it through, the message percolating up the hierarchy is
being blocked at the last minute and \fInot\fR appended to \f(CW\*(C`Screen1\*(C'\fR.
.PP
So far, we've been operating well within the boundaries of the 
Log4j standard, which Log4perl adheres to. However, if 
you would really, really like to use a single appender 
and keep the message percolation intact without having to deal
with message duplication, there's a non-standard solution for you:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    log4perl.logger.Cat        = ERROR, Screen
\&    log4perl.logger.Cat.Subcat = WARN, Screen
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.Screen   = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
\&    log4perl.appender.Screen.layout = SimpleLayout
\&
\&    log4perl.oneMessagePerAppender = 1
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`oneMessagePerAppender\*(C'\fR flag will suppress duplicate messages
to the same appender. Again, that's non-standard. But way cool :).
.SS "How can I configure Log::Log4perl to send me email if something happens?"

Some incidents require immediate action. You can't wait until someone

The message of every log incident this appender gets

sent out by your application, filling up the receipient's inbox.
.PP
There's one caveat you need to know about: The \f(CW\*(C`Log::Dispatch::Email\*(C'\fR
hierarchy of appenders turns on \fIbuffering\fR by default. This means that
the appender will not send out messages right away but wait until a 
certain threshold has been reached. If you'd rather have your alerts
sent out immeditately, use
.PP
.Vb 1

to turn buffering off.
.SS "How can I write my own appender?"
.IX Subsection "How can I write my own appender?"
First off, Log::Log4perl comes with a set of standard appenders. Then,
there's a lot of Log4perl\-compatible appenders already
available on \s-1CPAN:\s0 Just run a search for \f(CW\*(C`Log::Dispatch\*(C'\fR on 
http://search.cpan.org and chances are that what you're looking for 
has already been developed, debugged and been used successfully 
in production \*(-- no need for you to reinvent the wheel.
.PP
Also, Log::Log4perl ships with a nifty database appender named
Log::Log4perl::Appender::DBI \*(-- check it out if talking to databases is your
desire.
.PP
But if you're up for a truly exotic task, you might have to write
an appender yourself. That's very easy \*(-- it takes no longer
than a couple of minutes.
.PP
Say, we wanted to create an appender of the class
\&\f(CW\*(C`ColorScreenAppender\*(C'\fR, which logs messages
to the screen in a configurable color. Just create a new class 
in \f(CW\*(C`ColorScreenAppender.pm\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    package ColorScreenAppender;
.Ve
.PP
Now let's assume that your Log::Log4perl
configuration file \f(CW\*(C`test.conf\*(C'\fR looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.logger = INFO, ColorApp
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.ColorApp=ColorScreenAppender
\&    log4perl.appender.ColorApp.color=blue
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.ColorApp.layout = PatternLayout
\&    log4perl.appender.ColorApp.layout.ConversionPattern=%d %m %n
.Ve
.PP
This will cause Log::Log4perl on \f(CW\*(C`init()\*(C'\fR to look for a class
ColorScreenAppender and call its constructor \fInew()\fR. Let's add
\&\fInew()\fR to ColorScreenAppender.pm:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    sub new {
\&        my($class, %options) = @_;
\&
\&        my $self = { %options };
\&        bless $self, $class;
\&
\&        return $self;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
To initialize this appender, Log::Log4perl will call 
and pass all attributes of the appender as defined in the configuration
file to the constructor as name/value pairs (in this case just one):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ColorScreenAppender\->new(color => "blue");
.Ve
.PP
The \fInew()\fR method listed above stores the contents of the
\&\f(CW%options\fR hash in the object's
instance data hash (referred to by \f(CW$self\fR).
That's all for initializing a new appender with Log::Log4perl.
.PP
Second, ColorScreenAppender needs to expose a 
\&\f(CW\*(C`log()\*(C'\fR method, which will be called by Log::Log4perl 
every time it thinks the appender should fire. Along with the
object reference (as usual in Perl's object world), \fIlog()\fR
will receive a list of name/value pairs, of which only the one
under the key \f(CW\*(C`message\*(C'\fR shall be of interest for now since it is the
message string to be logged. At this point, Log::Log4perl has already taken
care of joining the message to be a single string.
.PP
For our special appender ColorScreenAppender, we're using the
Term::ANSIColor module to colorize the output:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Term::ANSIColor;
\&
\&    sub log {
\&        my($self, %params) = @_;
\&
\&        print colored($params{message},
\&                      $self\->{color});
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The color (as configured in the Log::Log4perl configuration file) 
is available as \f(CW$self\fR\->{color} in the appender object. Don't
forget to return
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    1;
.Ve
.PP
at the end of ColorScreenAppender.pm and you're done. Install the new appender
somewhere where perl can find it and try it with a test script like
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&    Log::Log4perl\->init("test.conf");
\&    ERROR("blah");
.Ve
.PP
to see the new colored output. Is this cool or what?
.PP
And it gets even better: You can write dynamically generated appender 
classes using the \f(CW\*(C`Class::Prototyped\*(C'\fR module. Here's an example of
an appender prepending every outgoing message with a configurable
number of bullets:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Class::Prototyped;
\&
\&    my $class = Class::Prototyped\->newPackage(
\&      "MyAppenders::Bulletizer",
\&      bullets => 1,
\&      log     => sub {
\&        my($self, %params) = @_;
\&        print "*" x $self\->bullets(),
\&              $params{message};
\&      },
\&    );
\&
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&
\&    Log::Log4perl\->init(\e q{
\&      log4perl.logger = INFO, Bully
\&    
\&      log4perl.appender.Bully=MyAppenders::Bulletizer
\&      log4perl.appender.Bully.bullets=3
\&    
\&      log4perl.appender.Bully.layout = PatternLayout
\&      log4perl.appender.Bully.layout.ConversionPattern=%m %n
\&    });
\&
\&        # ... prints: "***Boo!\en";
\&    INFO "Boo!";
.Ve
.SS "How can I drill down on references before logging them?"
.IX Subsection "How can I drill down on references before logging them?"
If you've got a reference to a nested structure or object, then 
you probably don't want to log it as \f(CW\*(C`HASH(0x81141d4)\*(C'\fR but rather
dump it as something like
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $VAR1 = {
\&              \*(Aqa\*(Aq => \*(Aqb\*(Aq,
\&              \*(Aqd\*(Aq => \*(Aqe\*(Aq
\&            };
.Ve
.PP
via a module like Data::Dumper. While it's syntactically correct to say
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $logger\->debug(Data::Dumper::Dumper($ref));
.Ve
.PP
this call imposes a huge performance penalty on your application
if the message is suppressed by Log::Log4perl, because Data::Dumper
will perform its expensive operations in any case, because it doesn't
know that its output will be thrown away immediately.
.PP
As of Log::Log4perl 0.28, there's a better way: Use the 
message output filter format as in
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $logger\->debug( {filter => \e&Data::Dumper::Dumper,
\&                     value  => $ref} );
.Ve
.PP
and Log::Log4perl won't call the filter function unless the message really
gets written out to an appender. Just make sure to pass the whole slew as a
reference to a hash specifying a filter function (as a sub reference)
under the key \f(CW\*(C`filter\*(C'\fR and the value to be passed to the filter function in
\&\f(CW\*(C`value\*(C'\fR). 
When it comes to logging, Log::Log4perl will call the filter function,
pass the \f(CW\*(C`value\*(C'\fR as an argument and log the return value.
Saves you serious cycles.
.SS "How can I collect all \s-1FATAL\s0 messages in an extra log file?"
.IX Subsection "How can I collect all FATAL messages in an extra log file?"
Suppose you have employed Log4perl all over your system and you've already
activated logging in various subsystems. On top of that, without disrupting
any other settings, how can you collect all \s-1FATAL\s0 messages all over the system
and send them to a separate log file?
.PP
If you define a root logger like this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    log4perl.logger                  = FATAL, File
\&    log4perl.appender.File           = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
\&    log4perl.appender.File.filename  = /tmp/fatal.txt
\&    log4perl.appender.File.layout    = PatternLayout
\&    log4perl.appender.File.layout.ConversionPattern= %d %m %n
\&        # !!! Something\*(Aqs missing ...
.Ve
.PP
you'll be surprised to not only receive all \s-1FATAL\s0 messages
issued anywhere in the system,
but also everything else \*(-- gazillions of 
\&\s-1ERROR\s0, \s-1WARN\s0, \s-1INFO\s0 and even \s-1DEBUG\s0 messages will end up in
your fatal.txt logfile!
Reason for this is Log4perl's (or better: Log4j's) appender additivity. 
Once a 
lower-level logger decides to fire, the message is going to be forwarded
to all appenders upstream \*(-- without further priority checks with their
attached loggers.
.PP
There's a way to prevent this, however: If your appender defines a
minimum threshold, only messages of this priority or higher are going
to be logged. So, just add
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.appender.File.Threshold = FATAL
.Ve
.PP
to the configuration above, and you'll get what you wanted in the 
first place: An overall system \s-1FATAL\s0 message collector.
.SS "How can I bundle several log messages into one?"
.IX Subsection "How can I bundle several log messages into one?"
Would you like to tally the messages arriving at your appender and
dump out a summary once they're exceeding a certain threshold?
So that something like
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $logger\->error("Blah");
\&    $logger\->error("Blah");
\&    $logger\->error("Blah");

but as

.Vb 1
\&    [3] Blah
.Ve
.PP
instead? If you'd like to hold off on logging a message until it has been
sent a couple of times, you can roll that out by creating a buffered 
appender.
.PP
Let's define a new appender like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    package TallyAppender;
\&
\&    sub new {
\&        my($class, %options) = @_;
\&
\&        my $self = { maxcount => 5,
\&                     %options
\&                   };
\&
\&        bless $self, $class;
\&
\&        $self\->{last_message}        = "";
\&        $self\->{last_message_count}  = 0;
\&
\&        return $self;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
with two additional instance variables \f(CW\*(C`last_message\*(C'\fR and 
\&\f(CW\*(C`last_message_count\*(C'\fR, storing the content of the last message sent
and a counter of how many times this has happened. Also, it features
a configuration parameter \f(CW\*(C`maxcount\*(C'\fR which defaults to 5 in the
snippet above but can be set in the Log4perl configuration file like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    log4perl.logger = INFO, A
\&    log4perl.appender.A=TallyAppender
\&    log4perl.appender.A.maxcount = 3
.Ve
.PP
The main tallying logic lies in the appender's \f(CW\*(C`log\*(C'\fR method,
which is called every time Log4perl thinks a message needs to get logged
by our appender:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    sub log {
\&        my($self, %params) = @_;
\&
\&            # Message changed? Print buffer.
\&        if($self\->{last_message} and
\&           $params{message} ne $self\->{last_message}) {
\&            print "[$self\->{last_message_count}]: " .
\&                  "$self\->{last_message}";
\&            $self\->{last_message_count} = 1;
\&            $self\->{last_message} = $params{message};
\&            return;
\&        }
\&
\&        $self\->{last_message_count}++;
\&        $self\->{last_message} = $params{message};
\&
\&            # Threshold exceeded? Print, reset counter
\&        if($self\->{last_message_count} >= 
\&           $self\->{maxcount}) {
\&            print "[$self\->{last_message_count}]: " .
\&                  "$params{message}";
\&            $self\->{last_message_count} = 0;
\&            $self\->{last_message}       = "";
\&            return;
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
We basically just check if the oncoming message in \f(CW$param{message}\fR
is equal to what we've saved before in the \f(CW\*(C`last_message\*(C'\fR instance
variable. If so, we're increasing \f(CW\*(C`last_message_count\*(C'\fR.
We print the message in two cases: If the new message is different
than the buffered one, because then we need to dump the old stuff
and store the new. Or, if the counter exceeds the threshold, as
defined by the \f(CW\*(C`maxcount\*(C'\fR configuration parameter.
.PP
Please note that the appender always gets the fully rendered message and
just compares it as a whole \*(-- so if there's a date/timestamp in there,
that might confuse your logic. You can work around this by specifying
\&\f(CW%m\fR \f(CW%n\fR as a layout and add the date later on in the appender. Or, make
the comparison smart enough to omit the date.
.PP
At last, don't forget what happens if the program is being shut down.
If there's still messages in the buffer, they should be printed out
at that point. That's easy to do in the appender's \s-1DESTROY\s0 method,
which gets called at object destruction time:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    sub DESTROY {
\&        my($self) = @_;
\&
\&        if($self\->{last_message_count}) {
\&            print "[$self\->{last_message_count}]: " .
\&                  "$self\->{last_message}";
\&            return;
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
This will ensure that none of the buffered messages are lost. 
Happy buffering!
.SS "I want to log \s-1ERROR\s0 and \s-1WARN\s0 messages to different files! How can I do that?"
.IX Subsection "I want to log ERROR and WARN messages to different files! How can I do that?"
Let's assume you wanted to have each logging statement written to a
different file, based on the statement's priority. Messages with priority
\&\f(CW\*(C`WARN\*(C'\fR are supposed to go to \f(CW\*(C`/tmp/app.warn\*(C'\fR, events prioritized
as \f(CW\*(C`ERROR\*(C'\fR should end up in \f(CW\*(C`/tmp/app.error\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Now, if you define two appenders \f(CW\*(C`AppWarn\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`AppError\*(C'\fR
and assign them both to the root logger,
messages bubbling up from any loggers below will be logged by both
appenders because of Log4perl's message propagation feature. If you limit
their exposure via the appender threshold mechanism and set 
\&\f(CW\*(C`AppWarn\*(C'\fR's threshold to \f(CW\*(C`WARN\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`AppError\*(C'\fR's to \f(CW\*(C`ERROR\*(C'\fR, you'll
still get \f(CW\*(C`ERROR\*(C'\fR messages in \f(CW\*(C`AppWarn\*(C'\fR, because \f(CW\*(C`AppWarn\*(C'\fR's \f(CW\*(C`WARN\*(C'\fR
setting will just filter out messages with a \fIlower\fR priority than
\&\f(CW\*(C`WARN\*(C'\fR \*(-- \f(CW\*(C`ERROR\*(C'\fR is higher and will be allowed to pass through.
.PP
What we need for this is a Log4perl \fICustom Filter\fR, available with 
Log::Log4perl 0.30.
.PP
Both appenders need to verify that
the priority of the oncoming messages exactly \fImatches\fR the priority 
the appender is supposed to log messages of. To accomplish this task,
let's define two custom filters, \f(CW\*(C`MatchError\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`MatchWarn\*(C'\fR, which,
when attached to their appenders, will limit messages passed on to them
to those matching a given priority:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.logger = WARN, AppWarn, AppError
\&
\&        # Filter to match level ERROR
\&    log4perl.filter.MatchError = Log::Log4perl::Filter::LevelMatch
\&    log4perl.filter.MatchError.LevelToMatch  = ERROR
\&    log4perl.filter.MatchError.AcceptOnMatch = true
\&
\&        # Filter to match level WARN
\&    log4perl.filter.MatchWarn  = Log::Log4perl::Filter::LevelMatch
\&    log4perl.filter.MatchWarn.LevelToMatch  = WARN
\&    log4perl.filter.MatchWarn.AcceptOnMatch = true

\&    log4perl.appender.AppError.layout   = SimpleLayout

\&
\&        # Warning appender

\&    log4perl.appender.AppWarn.layout   = SimpleLayout

.Ve
.PP
The appenders \f(CW\*(C`AppWarn\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`AppError\*(C'\fR defined above are logging to \f(CW\*(C`/tmp/app.warn\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`/tmp/app.err\*(C'\fR respectively and have the custom filters \f(CW\*(C`MatchWarn\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`MatchError\*(C'\fR
attached.

.SS "On our server farm, Log::Log4perl configuration files differ slightly from host to host. Can I roll them all into one?"
.IX Subsection "On our server farm, Log::Log4perl configuration files differ slightly from host to host. Can I roll them all into one?"
You sure can, because Log::Log4perl allows you to specify attribute values 
dynamically. Let's say that one of your appenders expects the host's \s-1IP\s0 address
as one of its attributes. Now, you could certainly roll out different 
configuration files for every host and specify the value like
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    log4perl.appender.MyAppender    = Log::Log4perl::Appender::SomeAppender
\&    log4perl.appender.MyAppender.ip = 10.0.0.127
.Ve
.PP
but that's a maintenance nightmare. Instead, you can have Log::Log4perl 
figure out the \s-1IP\s0 address at configuration time and set the appender's
value correctly:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        # Set the IP address dynamically
\&    log4perl.appender.MyAppender    = Log::Log4perl::Appender::SomeAppender
\&    log4perl.appender.MyAppender.ip = sub { \e
\&       use Sys::Hostname; \e
\&       use Socket; \e
\&       return inet_ntoa(scalar gethostbyname hostname); \e
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
If Log::Log4perl detects that an attribute value starts with something like
\&\f(CW"sub {..."\fR, it will interpret it as a perl subroutine which is to be executed
once at configuration time (not runtime!) and its return value is
to be used as the attribute value. This comes in handy
for rolling out applications whichs Log::Log4perl configuration files
show small host-specific differences, because you can deploy the unmodified
application distribution on all instances of the server farm.
.SS "Log4perl doesn't interpret my backslashes correctly!"

If you're using Log4perl's feature to specify the configuration as a

What's wrong? The problem is that you're using a here-document with
substitution enabled (\f(CW\*(C`<<END_HERE\*(C'\fR) and that Perl won't 
interpret backslashes at line-ends as continuation characters but

will look like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.appender.A1.layout =
.Ve
.PP
to Log::Log4perl which causes it to report an error. To interpret the backslash
at the end of the line correctly as a line-continuation character, use
the non-interpreting mode of the here-document like in

(note the single quotes around \f(CW\*(AqEND_HERE\*(Aq\fR) or use \f(CW\*(C`q{...}\*(C'\fR

Log4perl right out of the box and allows you to define a text pattern to match
(as a perl regular expression) and a flag \f(CW\*(C`AcceptOnMatch\*(C'\fR indicating
if a match is supposed to suppress the message or let it pass through.
.PP
The last line then assigns this filter to the \f(CW\*(C`A1\*(C'\fR appender, which will
call it every time it receives a message to be logged and throw all

Instead of using the standard \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl::Filter::StringMatch\*(C'\fR filter,

.SS "My new module uses Log4perl \*(-- but what happens if the calling program didn't configure it?"
.IX Subsection "My new module uses Log4perl  but what happens if the calling program didn't configure it?"
If a Perl module uses Log::Log4perl, it will typically rely on the
calling program to initialize it. If it is using Log::Log4perl in \f(CW\*(C`:easy\*(C'\fR
mode, like in
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package MyMod;
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&
\&    sub foo {
\&        DEBUG("In foo");
\&    }
\&
\&    1;
.Ve
.PP
and the calling program doesn't initialize Log::Log4perl at all (e.g. because
it has no clue that it's available), Log::Log4perl will silently
ignore all logging messages. However, if the module is using Log::Log4perl 
in regular mode like in
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package MyMod;
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger);
\&
\&    sub foo {
\&        my $logger = get_logger("");
\&        $logger\->debug("blah");
\&    }
\&
\&    1;
.Ve
.PP
and the main program is just using the module like in
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use MyMode;
\&    MyMode::foo();
.Ve
.PP
then Log::Log4perl will also ignore all logging messages but
issue a warning like
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    Log4perl: Seems like no initialization happened. 
\&    Forgot to call init()?
.Ve
.PP
(only once!) to remind novice users to not forget to initialize 
the logging system before using it. 
However, if you want to suppress this message, just
add the \f(CW\*(C`:nowarn\*(C'\fR target to the module's \f(CW\*(C`use Log::Log4perl\*(C'\fR call:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger :nowarn);
.Ve
.PP
This will have Log::Log4perl silently ignore all logging statements if
no initialization has taken place. If, instead of using \fIinit()\fR, you're 
using Log4perl's \s-1API\s0 to define loggers and appenders, the same 
notification happens if no call to \fIadd_appenders()\fR is made, i.e. no
appenders are defined.
.PP
If the module wants to figure out if some other program part has 
already initialized Log::Log4perl, it can do so by calling
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Log::Log4perl::initialized()
.Ve
.PP
which will return a true value in case Log::Log4perl has been initialized 
and a false value if not.
.SS "How can I synchronize access to an appender?"
.IX Subsection "How can I synchronize access to an appender?"
If you're using the same instance of an appender in multiple processes, 
and each process is passing on messages to the appender in parallel,
you might end up with overlapping log entries.
.PP
Typical scenarios include a file appender that you create in the main 
program, and which will then be shared between the parent and a 
forked child process. Or two separate processes, each initializing a
Log4perl file appender on the same logfile.
.PP
Log::Log4perl won't synchronize access to the shared logfile by
default. Depending on your operating system's flush mechanism,
buffer size and the size of your messages, there's a small chance of
an overlap.
.PP
The easiest way to prevent overlapping messages in logfiles written to
by multiple processes is setting the 
file appender's \f(CW\*(C`syswrite\*(C'\fR flag along with a file write mode of \f(CW"append"\fR. 
This makes sure that
\&\f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl::Appender::File\*(C'\fR uses \f(CW\*(C`syswrite()\*(C'\fR (which is guaranteed
to run uninterrupted) instead of \f(CW\*(C`print()\*(C'\fR which might buffer
the message or get interrupted by the \s-1OS\s0 while it is writing. And in
\&\f(CW"append"\fR mode, the \s-1OS\s0 kernel ensures that multiple processes share
one end-of-file marker, ensuring that each process writes to the \fIreal\fR 
end of the file. (The value of \f(CW"append"\fR 
for the \f(CW\*(C`mode\*(C'\fR parameter is the default setting in Log4perl's file 
appender so you don't have to set it explicitely.)
.PP
.Vb 1
\&      # Guarantees atomic writes
\&
\&    log4perl.category.Bar.Twix          = WARN, Logfile
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile           = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.mode      = append
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.syswrite  = 1
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename  = test.log
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.layout    = SimpleLayout
.Ve
.PP
Another guaranteed way of having messages separated with any kind of
appender is putting a Log::Log4perl::Appender::Synchronized composite
appender in between Log::Log4perl and the real appender. It will make
sure to let messages pass through this virtual gate one by one only.
.PP
Here's a sample configuration to synchronize access to a file appender:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.category.Bar.Twix          = WARN, Syncer
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile           = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.autoflush = 1
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename  = test.log
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.layout    = SimpleLayout
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.Syncer            = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Synchronized
\&    log4perl.appender.Syncer.appender   = Logfile
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl::Appender::Synchronized\*(C'\fR uses 
the \f(CW\*(C`IPC::Shareable\*(C'\fR module and its semaphores, which will slow down writing
the log messages, but ensures sequential access featuring atomic checks.
Check Log::Log4perl::Appender::Synchronized for details.
.SS "Can I use Log::Log4perl with log4j's Chainsaw?"

Install and start Chainsaw, which is part of the \f(CW\*(C`log4j\*(C'\fR distribution now

.IP "\(bu" 4
Configure Log::Log4perl to use a socket appender with an XMLLayout, pointing
to the host/port where Chainsaw (as configured above) is waiting with its
XMLSocketReceiver:

.SS "How can I run Log::Log4perl under mod_perl?"
.IX Subsection "How can I run Log::Log4perl under mod_perl?"
In persistent environments it's important to play by the rules outlined
in section \*(L"Initialize once and only once\*(R" in Log::Log4perl. 
If you haven't read this yet, please go ahead and read it right now. It's 
very important.
.PP
And no matter if you use a startup handler to \fIinit()\fR Log::Log4perl or use the
\&\fIinit_once()\fR strategy (added in 0.42), either way you're very likely to have
unsynchronized writes to logfiles.
.PP
If Log::Log4perl is configured with a log file appender, and it is 
initialized via
the Apache startup handler, the file handle created initially will be
shared among all Apache processes. Similarly, with the \fIinit_once()\fR
approach: although every process has a separate L4p configuration,
processes are gonna share the appender file \fInames\fR instead, effectively
opening several different file handles on the same file.
.PP
Now, having several appenders using the same file handle or having
several appenders logging to the same file unsynchronized, this might
result in overlapping messages. Sometimes, this is acceptable. If it's
not, here's two strategies:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Use the Log::Log4perl::Appender::Synchronized appender to connect to 
your file appenders. Here's the writeup: 
http://log4perl.sourceforge.net/releases/Log\-Log4perl/docs/html/Log/Log4perl/FAQ.html#23804
.IP "\(bu" 4
Use a different logfile for every process like in
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&     #log4perl.conf
\&     ...
\&     log4perl.appender.A1.filename = sub { "mylog.$$.log" }
.Ve
.SS "My program already uses \fIwarn()\fP and \fIdie()\fP. How can I switch to Log4perl?"
.IX Subsection "My program already uses warn() and die(). How can I switch to Log4perl?"
If your program already uses Perl's \f(CW\*(C`warn()\*(C'\fR function to spew out 
error messages and you'd like to channel those into the Log4perl world,
just define a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_WARN_\|_\*(C'\fR handler where your program or module resides:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&
\&    $SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_} = sub {
\&        local $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth =
\&            $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth + 1;
\&        WARN @_;
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Why the \f(CW\*(C`local\*(C'\fR setting of \f(CW$Log::Log4perl::caller_depth\fR? 
If you leave that out,
\&\f(CW\*(C`PatternLayout\*(C'\fR conversion specifiers like \f(CW%M\fR or \f(CW%F\fR (printing
the current function/method and source filename) will refer
to where the _\|_WARN_\|_ handler resides, not the environment 
Perl's \f(CW\*(C`warn()\*(C'\fR function was issued from. Increasing \f(CW\*(C`caller_depth\*(C'\fR 
adjusts for this offset. Having it \f(CW\*(C`local\*(C'\fR, makes sure the level 
gets set back after the handler exits.
.PP
Once done, if your program does something like
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    sub some_func {
\&        warn "Here\*(Aqs a warning";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
you'll get (depending on your Log::Log4perl configuration) something like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    2004/02/19 20:41:02\-main::some_func: Here\*(Aqs a warning at ./t line 25.
.Ve
.PP
in the appropriate appender instead of having a screen full of \s-1STDERR\s0
messages. It also works with the \f(CW\*(C`Carp\*(C'\fR module and its \f(CW\*(C`carp()\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`cluck()\*(C'\fR functions.
.PP
If, on the other hand, catching \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR and friends is 
required, a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DIE_\|_\*(C'\fR handler is appropriate:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    $SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_} = sub {
\&        if($^S) {
\&            # We\*(Aqre in an eval {} and don\*(Aqt want log
\&            # this message but catch it later
\&            return;
\&        }
\&        local $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth =
\&            $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth + 1;
\&        LOGDIE @_;
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
This will call Log4perl's \f(CW\*(C`LOGDIE()\*(C'\fR function, which will log a fatal
error and then call \fIdie()\fR internally, causing the program to exit. Works
equally well with \f(CW\*(C`Carp\*(C'\fR's \f(CW\*(C`croak()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`confess()\*(C'\fR functions.

This snippet will first probe for Log::Log4perl, and if it can't be found,
it will alias \s-1\fIDEBUG\s0()\fR, \s-1\fIINFO\s0()\fR, with empty subroutines via typeglobs.
If Log::Log4perl is available, its level constants are first imported
(\f(CW$DEBUG\fR, \f(CW$INFO\fR, etc.) and then \f(CW\*(C`easy_init()\*(C'\fR gets called to initialize
the logging system.
.SS "Can file appenders create files with different permissions?"
.IX Subsection "Can file appenders create files with different permissions?"
Typically, when \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl::Appender::File\*(C'\fR creates a new file,
its permissions are set to \f(CW\*(C`rw\-r\-\-r\-\-\*(C'\fR. Why? Because your
environment's \fIumask\fR most likely defaults to
\&\f(CW0022\fR, that's the standard setting.
.PP
What's a \fIumask\fR, you're asking? It's a template that's applied to
the permissions of all newly created files. While calls like
\&\f(CW\*(C`open(FILE, ">foo")\*(C'\fR will always try to create files in \f(CW\*(C`rw\-rw\-rw\-
\&\*(C'\fR mode, the system will apply the current \fIumask\fR template to
determine the final permission setting. \fIumask\fR is a bit mask that's
inverted and then applied to the requested permission setting, using a
bitwise \s-1AND:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $request_permission &~ $umask
.Ve
.PP
So, a \fIumask\fR setting of 0000 (the leading 0 simply indicates an
octal value) will create files in \f(CW\*(C`rw\-rw\-rw\-\*(C'\fR mode, a setting of 0277
will use \f(CW\*(C`r\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\*(C'\fR, and the standard 0022 will use \f(CW\*(C`rw\-r\-\-r\-\-\*(C'\fR.
.PP
As an example, if you want your log files to be created with
\&\f(CW\*(C`rw\-r\-\-rw\-\*(C'\fR permissions, use a \fIumask\fR of \f(CW0020\fR before
calling Log::Log4perl\->\fIinit()\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Log::Log4perl;
\&
\&    umask 0020;
\&        # Creates log.out in rw\-r\-\-rw mode
\&    Log::Log4perl\->init(\e q{
\&        log4perl.logger = WARN, File

it won't work. The reason is that \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl\*(C'\fR defines an
\&\s-1END\s0 block that cleans up all loggers. And perl will run \s-1END\s0 blocks
in the reverse order as they're encountered in the compile phase,
so in the scenario above, the \s-1END\s0 block will run \fIafter\fR Log4perl
has cleaned up its loggers.
.PP
Placing \s-1END\s0 blocks using Log4perl \fIafter\fR
a \f(CW\*(C`use Log::Log4perl\*(C'\fR statement fixes the problem:

This warning shows up when Unicode strings are printed without

If the complaining appender is a screen appender, set its \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR option:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&      log4perl.appender.Screen.stderr = 1
\&      log4perl.appender.Screen.utf8   = 1
.Ve
.PP
Alternatively, \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR does the trick:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&      # Either STDOUT ...
\&    binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8);
\&
\&      # ... or STDERR.
\&    binmode(STDERR, ":utf8);
.Ve
.PP
Some background on this: Perl's strings are either byte strings or
Unicode strings. \f(CW"Mike"\fR is a byte string.
\&\f(CW"\ex{30DE}\ex{30A4}\ex{30AF}"\fR is a Unicode string. Unicode strings are
marked specially and are \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded internally.
.PP
If you print a byte string to \s-1STDOUT\s0,
all is well, because \s-1STDOUT\s0 is by default set to byte mode. However,
if you print a Unicode string to \s-1STDOUT\s0 without precautions, \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR
will try to transform the Unicode string back to a byte string before
printing it out. This is troublesome if the Unicode string contains
\&'wide' characters which can't be represented in Latin\-1.
.PP
For example, if you create a Unicode string with three japanese Katakana
characters as in
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-le \*(Aqprint "\ex{30DE}\ex{30A4}\ex{30AF}"\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
(coincidentally pronounced Ma-i-ku, the japanese pronounciation of 
\&\*(L"Mike\*(R"), \s-1STDOUT\s0 is in byte mode and the warning
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Wide character in print at ./script.pl line 14.
.Ve
.PP
appears. Setting \s-1STDOUT\s0 to \s-1UTF\-8\s0 mode as in
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-le \*(Aqbinmode(STDOUT, ":utf8"); print "\ex{30DE}\ex{30A4}\ex{30AF}"\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
will silently print the Unicode string to \s-1STDOUT\s0 in \s-1UTF\-8\s0. To see the 
characters printed, you'll need a \s-1UTF\-8\s0 terminal with a font including
japanese Katakana characters.
.SS "How can I send errors to the screen, and debug messages to a file?"
.IX Subsection "How can I send errors to the screen, and debug messages to a file?"
Let's assume you want to maintain a detailed \s-1DEBUG\s0 output in a file
and only messages of level \s-1ERROR\s0 and higher should be printed on the
screen. Often times, developers come up with something like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&     # Wrong!!!
\&    log4perl.logger = DEBUG, FileApp
\&    log4perl.logger = ERROR, ScreenApp
\&     # Wrong!!!
.Ve
.PP
This won't work, however. Logger definitions aren't additive, and the
second statement will overwrite the first one. Log4perl versions
below 1.04 were silently accepting this, leaving people confused why
it wouldn't work as expected.
As of 1.04, this will throw a \fIfatal error\fR to notify the user of
the problem.
.PP
What you want to do instead, is this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.logger                    = DEBUG, FileApp, ScreenApp
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.filename = test.log
\&    log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout   = SimpleLayout
\&
\&    log4perl.appender.ScreenApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen

\&       ### limiting output to ERROR messages
\&    log4perl.appender.ScreenApp.Threshold = ERROR
\&       ###
.Ve
.PP
Note that without the second appender's \f(CW\*(C`Threshold\*(C'\fR setting, both appenders
would receive all messages prioritized \s-1DEBUG\s0 and higher. With the
threshold set to \s-1ERROR\s0, the second appender will filter the messages
as required.
.SS "Where should I put my logfiles?"
.IX Subsection "Where should I put my logfiles?"
Your log files may go anywhere you want them, but the effective
user id of the calling process must have write access.
.PP
If the log file doesn't exist at program start, Log4perl's file appender
will create it. For this, it needs write access to the directory where
the new file will be located in. If the log file already exists at startup,
the process simply needs write access to the file. Note that it will
need write access to the file's directory if you're encountering situations
where the logfile gets recreated, e.g. during log rotation.
.PP
If Log::Log4perl is used by a web server application (e.g. in a \s-1CGI\s0 script
or mod_perl), then the webserver's user (usually \f(CW\*(C`nobody\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`www\*(C'\fR)
must have the permissions mentioned above.
.PP
To prepare your web server to use log4perl, we'd recommend:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    webserver:~$ su \-
\&    webserver:~# mkdir /var/log/cgiapps
\&    webserver:~# chown nobody:root /var/log/cgiapps/

\&    webserver:~# chmod 02755 \-R /var/log/cgiapps/
.Ve
.PP
Then set your /etc/log4perl.conf file to include:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    log4perl.appender.FileAppndr1.filename = 
\&        /var/log/cgiapps/<app\-name>.log
.Ve
.SS "How can my file appender deal with disappearing log files?"
.IX Subsection "How can my file appender deal with disappearing log files?"
The file appender that comes with Log4perl, Log::Log4perl::Appender::File,
will open a specified log file at initialization time and will
keep writing to it via a file handle.
.PP
In case the associated file goes way, messages written by a 
long-running process will still be written
to the file handle. In case the file has been moved to a different 
location on the same file system, the writer will keep writing to
it under the new filename. In case the file has been removed from
the file system, the log messages will end up in nowhere land. This 
is not a bug in Log4perl, this is how Unix works. There is
no error message in this case, because the writer has no idea that
the file handle is not associated with a visible file.
.PP
To prevent the loss of log messages when log files disappear, the
file appender's \f(CW\*(C`recreate\*(C'\fR option needs to be set to a true value:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate = 1
.Ve
.PP
This will instruct the file appender to check in regular intervals
(default: 30 seconds) if the log file is still there. If it finds
out that the file is missing, it will recreate it.
.PP
Continuously checking if the log file still exists is fairly
expensive. For this reason it is only performed every 30 seconds. To
change this interval, the option \f(CW\*(C`recreate_check_interval\*(C'\fR can be set
to the number of seconds between checks. In the extreme case where the
check should be performed before every write, it can even be set to 0:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate = 1
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate_check_interval = 0
.Ve
.PP
To avoid having to check the file system so frequently, a signal
handler can be set up:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate = 1
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate_check_signal = USR1
.Ve
.PP
This will install a signal handler which will recreate a missing log file
immediatly when it receives the defined signal.
.PP
Note that the \fIinit_and_watch()\fR method for Log4perl's initialization
can also be instructed to install a signal handler, usually using the
\&\s-1HUP\s0 signal. Make sure to use a different signal if you're using both
of them at the same time.

in long-running processes.
.PP
For example, with a newsyslog configuration like
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # newsyslog.conf
\&    /tmp/test.log 666  12  5  *  B
.Ve
.PP

.PP
.Vb 1
\&    # newsyslog \-f /path/to/newsyslog.conf
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`newsyslog\*(C'\fR will take action if \f(CW\*(C`/tmp/test.log\*(C'\fR is larger than the 
specified 5K in size. It will move the current log file \f(CW\*(C`/tmp/test.log\*(C'\fR to 
\&\f(CW\*(C`/tmp/test.log.0\*(C'\fR and create a new and empty \f(CW\*(C`/tmp/test.log\*(C'\fR with
the specified permissions (this is why \f(CW\*(C`newsyslog\*(C'\fR needs to run as root). 
An already existing \f(CW\*(C`/tmp/test.log.0\*(C'\fR would be moved to
\&\f(CW\*(C`/tmp/test.log.1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`/tmp/test.log.1\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`/tmp/test.log.2\*(C'\fR, and so
forth, for every one of a max number of 12 archived logfiles that have
been configured in \f(CW\*(C`newsyslog.conf\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Although a new file has been created, from Log4perl's appender's point
of view, this situation is identical to the one described in the
previous \s-1FAQ\s0 entry, labeled \f(CW\*(C`How can my file appender deal with
disappearing log files\*(C'\fR.
.PP
To make sure that log messages are written to the new log file and not
to an archived one or end up in nowhere land,
the appender's \f(CW\*(C`recreate\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`recreate_check_interval\*(C'\fR have to be
configured to deal with the 'disappearing' log file.
.PP
The situation gets interesting when \f(CW\*(C`newsyslog\*(C'\fR's option
to compress archived log files is enabled. This causes the
original log file not to be moved, but to disappear. If the
file appender isn't configured to recreate the logfile in this situation,
log messages will actually be lost without warning. This also
applies for the short time frame of \f(CW\*(C`recreate_check_interval\*(C'\fR seconds
in between the recreator's file checks.
.PP
To make sure that no messages get lost, one option is to set the
interval to
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate_check_interval = 0
.Ve
.PP
However, this is fairly expensive. A better approach is to define
a signal handler:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate = 1
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate_check_signal  = USR1
\&    log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate_pid_write = /tmp/myappid
.Ve
.PP
As a service for \f(CW\*(C`newsyslog\*(C'\fR users, Log4perl's file appender writes
the current process \s-1ID\s0 to a \s-1PID\s0 file specified by the \f(CW\*(C`recreate_pid_write\*(C'\fR
option.  \f(CW\*(C`newsyslog\*(C'\fR then needs to be configured as in
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # newsyslog.conf configuration for compressing archive files and
\&    # sending a signal to the Log4perl\-enabled application
\&    /tmp/test.log 666  12  5  *  B /tmp/myappid 30
.Ve
.PP
to send the defined signal (30, which is \s-1USR1\s0 on FreeBSD) to the
application process at rotation time. Note that the signal number
is different on Linux, where \s-1USR1\s0 denotes as 10. Check \f(CW\*(C`man signal\*(C'\fR
for details.
.SS "How can a process under user id A log to a file under user id B?"
.IX Subsection "How can a process under user id A log to a file under user id B?"
This scenario often occurs in configurations where processes run under
various user IDs but need to write to a log file under a fixed, but 
different user id.
.PP
With a traditional file appender, the log file will probably be created
under one user's id and appended to under a different user's id. With
a typical umask of 0002, the file will be created with \-rw\-rw\-r\*(--
permissions. If a user who's not in the first user's group
subsequently appends to the log file, it will fail because of a
permission problem.
.PP
Two potential solutions come to mind:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Creating the file with a umask of 0000 will allow all users to append
to the log file. Log4perl's file appender \f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl::Appender::File\*(C'\fR
has an \f(CW\*(C`umask\*(C'\fR option that can be set to support this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    log4perl.appender.File = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
\&    log4perl.appender.File.umask = sub { 0000 };
.Ve
.Sp
This way, the log file will be created with \-rw\-rw\-rw\- permissions and
therefore has world write permissions. This might open up the logfile
for unwanted manipulations by arbitrary users, though.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Running the process under an effective user id of \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR will allow
it to write to the log file, no matter who started the process.
However, this is not a good idea, because of security concerns.
.PP
Luckily, under Unix, there's the syslog daemon which runs as root and
takes log requests from user processes over a socket and writes them
to log files as configured in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/syslog.conf\*(C'\fR.
.PP
By modifying \f(CW\*(C`/etc/syslog.conf\*(C'\fR and HUPing the syslog daemon, you can
configure new log files:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # /etc/syslog.conf
\&    ...
\&    user.* /some/path/file.log
.Ve
.PP
Using the \f(CW\*(C`Log::Dispatch::Syslog\*(C'\fR appender, which comes with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Log::Log4perl\*(C'\fR distribution, you can then send messages via syslog:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&
\&    Log::Log4perl\->init(\e<<EOT);
\&        log4perl.logger = DEBUG, app
\&        log4perl.appender.app=Log::Dispatch::Syslog
\&        log4perl.appender.app.Facility=user
\&        log4perl.appender.app.layout=SimpleLayout
\&    EOT
\&    
\&        # Writes to /some/path/file.log
\&    ERROR "Message!";
.Ve
.PP
This way, the syslog daemon will solve the permission problem.
.PP
Note that while it is possible to use \fIsyslog()\fR without Log4perl (syslog
supports log levels, too), traditional syslog setups have a
significant drawback.
.PP
Without Log4perl's ability to activate logging in only specific
parts of a system, complex systems will trigger log events all over
the place and slow down execution to a crawl at high debug levels.
.PP
Remote-controlling logging in the hierarchical parts of an application
via Log4perl's categories is one of its most distinguished features.
It allows for enabling high debug levels in specified areas without
noticable performance impact.

If you're on Windows and are getting warning messages like

\&  Constant subroutine Log::Log4perl::_INTERNAL_DEBUG redefined at
\&    C:/Programme/Perl/lib/constant.pm line 103.
\&  Subroutine import redefined at

then chances are that you're using 'Log::Log4Perl' (wrong uppercase P) 
instead of the correct 'Log::Log4perl'. Perl on Windows doesn't
handle this error well and spits out a slew of confusing warning
messages. But now you know, just use the correct module name and
you'll be fine.
.SS "Log4perl complains that no initialization happened during shutdown!"
.IX Subsection "Log4perl complains that no initialization happened during shutdown!"
If you're using Log4perl log commands in \s-1DESTROY\s0 methods of your objects,
you might see confusing messages like
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    Log4perl: Seems like no initialization happened. Forgot to call init()?
\&    Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at
\&    /home/y/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Log/Log4perl.pm line 134 during global
\&    destruction. (in cleanup) Undefined subroutine &main:: called at
\&    /home/y/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Log/Log4perl.pm line 134 during global
\&    destruction.
.Ve
.PP
when the program shuts down. What's going on?
.PP
This phenomenon happens if you have circular references in your objects, 
which perl can't clean up when an object goes out of scope but waits
until global destruction instead. At this time, however, Log4perl has
already shut down, so you can't use it anymore.
.PP
For example, here's a simple class which uses a logger in its \s-1DESTROY\s0
method:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    package A;
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&    sub new { bless {}, shift }
\&    sub DESTROY { DEBUG "Waaah!"; }
.Ve
.PP
Now, if the main program creates a self-referencing object, like in
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    package main;
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&    Log::Log4perl\->easy_init($DEBUG);
\&
\&    my $a = A\->new();
\&    $a\->{selfref} = $a;
.Ve
.PP
then you'll see the error message shown above during global destruction.
How to tackle this problem?
.PP
First, you should clean up your circular references before global 
destruction. They will not only cause objects to be destroyed in an order
that's hard to predict, but also eat up memory until the program shuts
down.
.PP
So, the program above could easily be fixed by putting
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $a\->{selfref} = undef;
.Ve
.PP
at the end or in an \s-1END\s0 handler. If that's hard to do, use weak references:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    package main;
\&    use Scalar::Util qw(weaken);
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&    Log::Log4perl\->easy_init($DEBUG);
\&
\&    my $a = A\->new();
\&    $a\->{selfref} = weaken $a;
.Ve
.PP
This allows perl to clean up the circular reference when the object 
goes out of scope, and doesn't wait until global destruction.
.SS "How can I access \s-1POE\s0 heap values from Log4perl's layout?"
.IX Subsection "How can I access POE heap values from Log4perl's layout?"
\&\s-1POE\s0 is a framework for creating multitasked applications running in a
single process and a single thread. \s-1POE\s0's threads equivalents are
\&'sessions' and since they run quasi-simultaneously, you can't use
Log4perl's global \s-1NDC/MDC\s0 to hold session-specific data.
.PP
However, \s-1POE\s0 already maintains a data store for every session. It is called
\&'heap' and is just a hash storing session-specific data in key-value pairs.
To access this per-session heap data from a Log4perl layout, define a
custom cspec and reference it with the newly defined pattern in the layout:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use strict;
\&    use POE;
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&
\&    Log::Log4perl\->init( \e q{
\&        log4perl.logger = DEBUG, Screen
\&        log4perl.appender.Screen = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
\&        log4perl.appender.Screen.layout = PatternLayout
\&        log4perl.appender.Screen.layout.ConversionPattern = %U %m%n
\&        log4perl.PatternLayout.cspec.U = \e
\&            sub { POE::Kernel\->get_active_session\->get_heap()\->{ user } }
\&    } );
\&
\&    for (qw( Huey Lewey Dewey )) {
\&        POE::Session\->create(
\&            inline_states => {
\&                _start    => sub {
\&                    $_[HEAP]\->{user} = $_;
\&                    POE::Kernel\->yield(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq);
\&                },
\&                hello     => sub {
\&                    DEBUG "I\*(Aqm here now";
\&                }
\&            }
\&        );
\&    }
\&
\&    POE::Kernel\->run();
\&    exit;
.Ve
.PP
The code snippet above defines a new layout placeholder (called
\&'cspec' in Log4perl) \f(CW%U\fR which calls a subroutine, retrieves the active
session, gets its heap and looks up the entry specified ('user').
.PP
Starting with Log::Log4perl 1.20, cspecs also support parameters in 
curly braces, so you can say
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    log4perl.appender.Screen.layout.ConversionPattern = %U{user} %U{id} %m%n
\&    log4perl.PatternLayout.cspec.U = \e
\&            sub { POE::Kernel\->get_active_session\-> \e
\&                  get_heap()\->{ $_[0]\->{curlies} } }
.Ve
.PP
and print the \s-1POE\s0 session heap entries 'user' and 'id' with every logged
message. For more details on cpecs, read the PatternLayout manual.
.SS "I want to print something unconditionally!"
.IX Subsection "I want to print something unconditionally!"
Sometimes it's a script that's supposed to log messages regardless if
Log4perl has been initialized or not. Or there's a logging statement that's
not going to be suppressed under any circumstances \*(-- many people want to
have the final word, make the executive decision, because it seems like
the only logical choice.
.PP
But think about it:
First off, if a messages is supposed to be printed, where is it supposed
to end up at? \s-1STDOUT\s0? \s-1STDERR\s0? And are you sure you want to set in stone
that this message needs to be printed, while someone else might
find it annoying and wants to get rid of it?
.PP
The truth is, there's always going to be someone who wants to log a 
messages at all cost, but also another person who wants to suppress it
with equal vigilance. There's no good way to serve these two conflicting 
desires, someone will always want to win at the cost of leaving 
the other party dissappointed.
.PP
So, the best Log4perl offers is the \s-1ALWAYS\s0 level for a message that even
fires if the system log level is set to \f(CW$OFF:\fR
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
\&
\&    Log::Log4perl\->easy_init( $OFF );
\&    ALWAYS "This gets logged always. Well, almost always";
.Ve
.PP
The logger won't fire, though, if Log4perl hasn't been initialized or
if someone defines a custom log hurdle that's higher than \f(CW$OFF\fR.
.PP
Bottom line: Leave the setting of the logging level to the initial Perl 
script \*(-- let their owners decided what they want, no matter how tempting
it may be to decide it for them.
