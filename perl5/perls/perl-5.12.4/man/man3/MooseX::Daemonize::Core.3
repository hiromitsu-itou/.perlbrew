MooseX::Daemonize::Core \- A Role with the core daemonization features
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\&  package My::Daemon;
\&  use Moose;
\&
\&  with \*(AqMooseX::Daemonize::Core\*(Aq;
\&
\&  sub start {
\&      my $self = shift;
\&      # daemonize me ...
\&      $self\->daemonize;
\&      # return from the parent,...
\&      return unless $self\->is_daemon;
\&      # but continue on in the child (daemon)
\&  }
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is the basic daemonization Role, it provides a few methods (see
below) and the minimum features needed to properly daemonize your code.
.SS "Important Notes"
.IX Subsection "Important Notes"
None of the methods in this role will exit the parent process for you,
it only forks and detaches your child (daemon) process. It is your
responsibility to exit the parent process in some way.
.PP
There is no \s-1PID\s0 or \s-1PID\s0 file management in this role, that is your
responsibility (see some of the other roles in this distro for that).
.SH "ATTRIBUTES"
.IX Header "ATTRIBUTES"
.IP "\fIis_daemon (is =\fR rw, isa => Bool)>" 4
.IX Item "is_daemon (is = rw, isa => Bool)>"
This attribute is used to signal if we are within the
daemon process or not.
.IP "\fIno_double_fork (is =\fR rw, isa => Bool)>" 4
.IX Item "no_double_fork (is = rw, isa => Bool)>"
Setting this attribute to true will cause this method to not perform the
typical double-fork, which is extra added protection from your process
accidentally aquiring a controlling terminal. More information can be
found above, and by Googling \*(L"double fork daemonize\*(R".
.Sp
If you the double-fork behavior off, you might want to enable the
\&\fIignore_zombies\fR.
.IP "\fIignore_zombies (is =\fR rw, isa => Bool)>" 4
.IX Item "ignore_zombies (is = rw, isa => Bool)>"
Setting this attribute to a true value will result in setting the \f(CW$SIG{CHLD}\fR
handler to \f(CW\*(C`IGNORE\*(C'\fR. This tells perl to clean up zombie processes. By
default, and for the most part you don't \fIneed\fR it, only when you turn off
the double fork behavior (with the \fIno_double_fork\fR attribute)
do you sometimes want this behavior.
.IP "\fIdont_close_all_files (is =\fR rw, isa => Bool)>" 4
.IX Item "dont_close_all_files (is = rw, isa => Bool)>"
Setting this attribute to true will cause it to skip closing all the
filehandles. This is useful if you are opening things like sockets
and such in the pre-fork.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.IP "\fBdaemon_fork (?%options)\fR" 4
.IX Item "daemon_fork (?%options)"
This forks off the child process to be daemonized. Just as with
the built in fork, it returns the child pid to the parent process,
0 to the child process. It will also set the is_daemon flag
appropriately.
.Sp
The \f(CW%options\fR argument remains for backwards compatability, but
it is suggested that you use the attributes listed above instead.
.IP "\fBdaemon_detach (?%options)\fR" 4
.IX Item "daemon_detach (?%options)"
This detaches the new child process from the terminal by doing
the following things.
.Sp
The \f(CW%options\fR argument remains for backwards compatability, but
it is suggested that you use the attributes listed above instead.
.RS 4
.IP "Becomes a session leader" 4
.IX Item "Becomes a session leader"
This detaches the program from the controlling terminal, it is
accomplished by calling POSIX::setsid.
.IP "Performing the double-fork" 4
.IX Item "Performing the double-fork"
See below for information on how to change this part of the process.
.ie n .IP "Changes the current working directory to ""/""" 4
.el .IP "Changes the current working directory to ``/''" 4
.IX Item "Changes the current working directory to /"
This is standard daemon behavior, if you want a different working
directory then simply change it later in your daemons code.
.IP "Clears the file creation mask." 4
.IX Item "Clears the file creation mask."
.PD 0
.IP "Closes all open file descriptors." 4
.IX Item "Closes all open file descriptors."
.PD
See the \fIdont_close_all_files\fR attribute for information on how to
change this part of the process.
.IP "Reopen \s-1STDERR\s0, \s-1STDOUT\s0 & \s-1STDIN\s0 to /dev/null" 4
.IX Item "Reopen STDERR, STDOUT & STDIN to /dev/null"
This behavior can be controlled slightly though the \s-1MX_DAEMON_STDERR\s0
and \s-1MX_DAEMON_STDOUT\s0 environment variables. It will look for a filename
in either of these variables and redirect \s-1STDOUT\s0 and/or \s-1STDERR\s0 to those
files. This is useful for debugging and/or testing purposes.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR
.Sp
If called from within the parent process (the is_daemon flag is set to
false), this method will simply return and do nothing.
.IP "\fBdaemonize (?%options)\fR" 4
.IX Item "daemonize (?%options)"
This will simply call \f(CW\*(C`daemon_fork\*(C'\fR followed by \f(CW\*(C`daemon_detach\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The \f(CW%options\fR argument remains for backwards compatability, but
it is suggested that you use the attributes listed above instead.

.IP "Note about double fork" 4
.IX Item "Note about double fork"
Taken from <http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/66012>
in a comment entitled \fIThe second fork _is_ necessary by Jonathan Bartlett\fR,
it is not the definitive statement on the issue, but it's clear and well
written enough so I decided to reproduce it here.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  The first fork accomplishes two things \- allow the shell to return,
\&  and allow you to do a setsid().
\&
\&  The setsid() removes yourself from your controlling terminal. You
\&  see, before, you were still listed as a job of your previous process,
\&  and therefore the user might accidentally send you a signal. setsid()
\&  gives you a new session, and removes the existing controlling terminal.
\&
\&  The problem is, you are now a session leader. As a session leader, if
\&  you open a file descriptor that is a terminal, it will become your
\&  controlling terminal (oops!). Therefore, the second fork makes you NOT
\&  be a session leader. Only session leaders can acquire a controlling
\&  terminal, so you can open up any file you wish without worrying that
\&  it will make you a controlling terminal.
\&
\&  So \- first fork \- allow shell to return, and permit you to call setsid()
\&
\&  Second fork \- prevent you from accidentally reacquiring a controlling
\&  terminal.
.Ve
.Sp
That said, you don't always want this to be the behavior, so you are
free to specify otherwise using the \fIno_double_fork\fR attribute.
.IP "Note about zombies" 4
.IX Item "Note about zombies"
Doing the double fork (see above) tends to get rid of your zombies since
by the time you have double forked your daemon process is then owned by
the init process. However, sometimes the double-fork is more than you
really need, and you want to keep your daemon processes a little closer
to you. In this case you have to watch out for zombies, you can avoid then
by just setting the \fIignore_zombies\fR attribute (see above).
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
These variables are best just used for debugging and/or testing, but
not used for actual logging. For that, you should reopen \s-1STDOUT/ERR\s0 on
your own.
.IP "\fB\s-1MX_DAEMON_STDOUT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "MX_DAEMON_STDOUT"
A filename to redirect the daemon \s-1STDOUT\s0 to.
.IP "\fB\s-1MX_DAEMON_STDERR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "MX_DAEMON_STDERR"
A filename to redirect the daemon \s-1STDERR\s0 to.
