This module implements \f(CW\*(C`set_sig_handler()\*(C'\fR, which sets up a signal
handler and (optionally) returns an object which causes the signal
handler to be reset to the previous value, when it goes out of scope.
.PP
Also implemented is \f(CW\*(C`timeout_call()\*(C'\fR which takes a timeout value and
a code reference, and executes the code reference wrapped with an
alarm timeout. timeout_call accepts seconds in floating point format,
so you can time out call with a resolution of 0.000001 seconds (assumes 
Time::HiRes is loadable.
.PP
Finally, two convenience routines are defined which allow one to get the
signal name from the number \*(-- \f(CW\*(C`sig_name()\*(C'\fR, and get the signal number
from the name \*(-- \f(CW\*(C`sig_number()\*(C'\fR.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Prior to version 5.8.0 perl implemented 'unsafe' signal handling.
The reason it is consider unsafe, is that there is a risk that a
signal will arrive, and be handled while perl is changing internal
data structures.  This can result in all kinds of subtle and not so
subtle problems.  For this reason it has always been recommended that
one do as little as possible in a signal handler, and only variables
that already exist be manipulated.
.PP
Perl 5.8.0 and later versions implements 'safe' signal handling
on platforms which support the \s-1POSIX\s0 \fIsigaction()\fR function.  This is
accomplished by having perl note that a signal has arrived, but deferring
the execution of the signal handler until such time as it is safe to do
so.  Unfortunately these changes can break some existing scripts, if they
depended on a system routine being interrupted by the signal's arrival.
The perl 5.8.0 implementation was modified further in version 5.8.2.
.PP
From the perl 5.8.2 \fBperlvar\fR man page:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   The default delivery policy of signals changed in Perl 5.8.0 
\&   from immediate (also known as "unsafe") to deferred, also 
\&   known as "safe signals".
.Ve
.PP
The implementation of this changed the \f(CW\*(C`sa_flags\*(C'\fR with which
the signal handler is installed by perl, and it causes some
system routines (like \fIconnect()\fR) to return \s-1EINTR\s0, instead of another error
when the signal arrives.  The problem comes when the code that made 
the system call sees the \s-1EINTR\s0 code and decides it's going to call it 
again before returning. Perl doesn't do this but some libraries do, including for
instance, the Oracle \s-1OCI\s0 library.
.PP
Thus the 'deferred signal' approach (as implemented by default in
perl 5.8 and later) results in some system calls being
retried prior to the signal handler being called by perl. 
This breaks timeout logic for DBD-Oracle which works with
earlier versions of perl.  This can be particularly vexing, when, for instance,
the host on which a database resides is not available:  \f(CW\*(C`DBI\->connect()\*(C'\fR
hangs for minutes before returning an error (and cannot even be interrupted
with control-C, even when the intended timeout is only seconds). 
This is because \s-1SIGINT\s0 appears to be deferred as well.  The
result is that it is impossible to implement open timeouts with code
that looks like this in perl 5.8.0 and later:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&   eval {
\&      local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die "timeout" };
\&      alarm 2;
\&      $sth = DBI\->connect(...);
\&      alarm 0;
\&   };
\&   alarm 0;
\&   die if $@;
.Ve
.PP
Or as the author of bug #50628 pointed out, 
might probably better be written as:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&   eval {
\&      local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die "timeout" };
\&      eval {
\&         alarm 2;
\&         $sth = DBI\->connect(...);
\&         alarm 0;
\&      };
\&   }
\&   alarm 0;
\&   die if $@;
.Ve
.PP
The solution, if your system has the \s-1POSIX\s0 \fIsigaction()\fR function,
is to use perl's \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::sigaction()\*(C'\fR to install the signal handler.
With \f(CW\*(C`sigaction()\*(C'\fR, one gets control over both the signal mask, and the
\&\f(CW\*(C`sa_flags\*(C'\fR that are used to install the handler.  Further, with perl
5.8.2 and later, a 'safe' switch is provided which can be used to ask
for safe(r) signal handling.
.PP
Using \fIsigaction()\fR ensures that the system call won't be
resumed after it's interrupted, so long as die is called
within the signal handler.  This is no longer the case when 
one uses \f(CW$SIG{name}\fR to set signal
handlers in perls >= 5.8.0.
.PP
The usage of \fIsigaction()\fR is not well documented however, and in perl
versions less than 5.8.0, it does not work at all. (But that's \s-1OK\s0, because
just setting \f(CW$SIG\fR does work in that case.)  Using \fIsigaction()\fR requires
approximately 4 or 5 lines of code where previously one only had to set
a code reference into the \f(CW%SIG\fR hash.
.PP
Unfortunately, at least with perl 5.8.0, the result is that doing this
effectively reverts to the 'unsafe' signals behavior.  It is not clear
whether this would be the case in perl 5.8.2, since the safe flag can be used
to ask for safe signal handling.  I suspect this separates the logic
which uses the \f(CW\*(C`sa_flags\*(C'\fR to install the handler, and whether deferred
signal handling is used.
.PP
The reader should also note, that the behavior of the 'safe' 
attribute is not consistent with what this author expected. 
Specifically, it appears to disable signal masking. This can be
examined further in the t/safe.t and the t/mask.t regression tests.
Never-the-less, Sys::SigAction provides an easy mechanism for
the user to recover the pre\-5.8.0 behavior for signal handling, and the
mask attribute clearly works. (see t/mask.t) If one is looking for
specific safe signal handling behavior that is considered broken,
and the breakage can be demonstrated, then a patch to t/safe.t would be 
most welcome.
.PP
This module wraps up the \s-1POSIX::\s0 routines and objects necessary to call
\&\fIsigaction()\fR in a way that is as efficient from a coding perspective as just
setting a localized \f(CW$SIG{SIGNAL}\fR with a code reference.  Further, the
user has control over the \f(CW\*(C`sa_flags\*(C'\fR passed to \fIsigaction()\fR.  By default,
if no additional args are passed to \fIsigaction()\fR, then the signal handler
will be called when a signal (such as \s-1SIGALRM\s0) is delivered.
.PP
Since \fIsigaction()\fR is not fully functional in perl versions less than
5.8, this module implements equivalent behavior using the standard
\&\f(CW%SIG\fR array.  The version checking and implementation of the 'right'
code is handled by this module, so the user does not have to write perl
version dependent code.  The attrs hashref argument to \fIset_sig_handler()\fR
is silently ignored, in perl versions less than 5.8.  This module has
been tested with perls as old as 5.005 on solaris.
.PP
It is hoped that with the use of this module, your signal handling
behavior can be coded in a way that does not change from one perl version
to the next, and that \fIsigaction()\fR will be easier for you to use.

.IX Header "Note on Double evals"
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 bug #50628 which was filed against Sys::SigAction\-0.11
noting that the sample code was \*(L"buggy\*(R" because the evals 
that wrapped the code we wanted to timeout
might die for an unanticipated reason, before the alarm could be cleared.
In that case, as the bug writer noted, if the alarm expires before the final \fIalarm\fR\|(0)
can be called, either the code will completely die because
there is no \s-1SIGALRM\s0 handler in place to catch the signal, or the
wrong handler (not the local handler) will be called.
.PP
All the code samples in this module have been modified to account for this.  
Additionally we have made the same change in \fItimeout_call()\fR which could
have exhibited this behavior, though the \s-1AUTHOR\s0 never knowing experienced it.
