.IP "2003/09/22" 4
.IX Item "2003/09/22"
Added support for lvalue methods to Template and Template::Generic. Added a few tests to demonstrate they're working. Added an example to Docs::Examples.
.Sp
Added Emulator::accessors and compatibility tests.
.Sp
Minor documentation improvements.
.SS "Version 1.008"
.IX Subsection "Version 1.008"
.IP "2003/09/05" 4
.IX Item "2003/09/05"
Adjusted layout of test directories in another attempt to solve a MakeMaker/shell\-glob issue on Windows that was preventing make test from running correctly.
.Sp
Removed Template::PseudoHash, since this package never really worked, as pointed out by a question from Mike Castle. Management of array-based objects can be handled by any of the existing ::Array subclasses, and support for pseudo-hashes would not provide any useful new capabilities.
.Sp
Added support for \*(L"Template::Universal:forward_methods \-delegate\*(R" and \*(L"Template::Generic:object \-\-soft_delegate\*(R" based on a suggestion from Peter Chen. Extended behavior of Template \-subs handling to make it easy to add such functionality in the future.
.Sp
Released to \s-1CPAN\s0 as Class\-MakeMethods\-1.008.tar.gz.
.IP "2003/09/02" 4
.IX Item "2003/09/02"
Adjusted \s-1DESTROY\s0 behavior of Template::InsideOut and cleaned up documentation.
.SS "Version 1.007"
.IX Subsection "Version 1.007"
.IP "2003/09/01" 4
.IX Item "2003/09/01"
Made Template definitions automatically import their class's generic
definitions, if present. This eliminates the need for Generic
subclasses to explicitly redeclare every method it inherits, and
should obviate the \*(L"missing declaration\*(R" problems referenced below.
.Sp
Updated the names of several Template subclasses, with stubs at
the old names for backwards compatibility: Flyweight becomes
InsideOut, Static becomes Global, and Struct becomes Array.
.Sp
Added Template::Inheritable and basic tests for it.
.Sp
Eliminated use of legacy Test.pm from remaining tests, except for
MethodMaker emulation.
.Sp
Rearranged test directories in an effort to avoid a reported bug
with the test path of t/*/*.t under Windows.
.Sp
Released to \s-1CPAN\s0 as Class\-MakeMethods\-1.007.tar.gz.
.IP "2003/08/27" 4
.IX Item "2003/08/27"
Added section to Class::MakeMethods/EXTENDING documentation based
on question from Terrence Brannon.
.IP "2003/02/07" 4
.IX Item "2003/02/07"
Fixed missing declaration of Template::Hash:instance, reported via \s-1RT\s0.
.SS "Version 1.006"
.IX Subsection "Version 1.006"
.IP "2003/01/26" 4
.IX Item "2003/01/26"
Additional documentation touch-ups. Moved miscellaneous \s-1POD\s0 files into the Docs directory.
.Sp
Added new test scripts from Class\-MethodMaker\-1.08, although we
don't yet pass them. In particular, I need to add support for the
new method types added in 1.04: tie_scalar, tie_list, object_tie_list,
object_tie_hash
.Sp
Also need to compare against the changes included in Class\-MethodMaker\-1.09 and 1.10, which don't seem to include any new test code, but do include functionality changes.
.IP "2002/12/12" 4
.IX Item "2002/12/12"
Re-integrated Template and Emulator packages; the separate distribution
turned out to be a hastle rather than a convenience. However, in
order to keep test scripts for each subsystem separate, I'm now
using a Makefile.PL attribute to specify a two-level deep directory
tree of test scripts; I hope this doesn't break on Windows...
.Sp
Fixed possible \*(L"use of undefined as a reference\*(R" problem in
Standard::*::array method generators, reported by Jared Rhine.
.Sp
Tried to improve documentation, based on feedback from Jared Rhine.
Expunged ReadMe.pod. Extracted method catalogs into Catalog.pod.
Moved examples to new Example.pod, although that underlines how
few examples there are.

.IX Item "2002/01/24"
Folded \*(L"Getting Started Guide\*(R" \s-1POD\s0 into main module documentation.
.Sp
Renamed Utility::TakeName to Emulator.
.Sp
Split Template and Emulator packages into their own distributions.
.Sp
\&\fBPlease Note:\fR This means that to fully upgrade you must retrieve
all three of these files:

.IP "2002/01/21" 4
.IX Item "2002/01/21"
Started bumping sub-version numbers and not using sub-sub-versions,
to shorten distribution names and more closely match standard
practice.
.Sp
Added Composite::Inheritable:hook and matching test. Added
Composite\->CurrentResults method to easily access, update composite
method results.

.IP "v1.000.16 \- 2002/01/20" 4
.IX Item "v1.000.16 - 2002/01/20"
Adjusted the hash and array methods in the Standard::* and Composite::*
packages to properly accept a set-contents call with a single
reference argument, and to return contents rather than ref in list
context.
.IP "v1.000.16 \- 2002/01/14" 4
.IX Item "v1.000.16 - 2002/01/14"
Fixed a subtle bug in a test script inherited from Class::MethodMaker:
4_Template_hash_hash_array.t and 7_MethodMaker_hash_of_lists.t both
relied on \*(L"keys \f(CW%hash\fR\*(R" returning the keys in a particular order,
which *almost* always worked, but caused failures on one or more
Perl version/platform combinations.
.IP "v1.000.15 \- 2002/01/14" 4
.IX Item "v1.000.15 - 2002/01/14"
Released to \s-1CPAN\s0 as v1.000.015.
.IP "v1.000.15 \- 2002/01/12" 4
.IX Item "v1.000.15 - 2002/01/12"
Renamed Basic::Static to Basic::Global for consistency with Standard
and Composite. Hopefully, there aren't many users of this module
yet; please accept my apologies if this breaks your code.
.Sp
Eliminated \*(L"local \f(CW@_\fR = ...\*(R", which appears to cause a scoping
problem on Perl 5.6. Thanks to Adam Spiers for a thorough bug
report. (See http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=138370 for
details.)
.Sp
Extended Template::Generic to support \*(L"array \-\-get_set_ref\*(R" method
style requested by Adam Spiers.
.Sp
Various documentation tweaks, including feedback from Adam Spiers:
Adjusted documentation to downplay Basic::* modules as a starting
point, in favor of Standard::* ones. Trimmed out some duplicated
documentation in favor of more \*(L"See L<...>\*(R" links. Adjusted
documentation of *::Inheritable packages in an attempt to clarify
the way in which the inheritance tree is searched for a value.
.Sp
Factored out common code from Standard::Inheritable and
Composite::Inheritable to new module, Utility::Inheritable. Factored
out common code from Standard::Hash and Standard::Array to new
module, Utility::ArraySplicer. Factored out common code from
Template::Universal to new module, Utility::Ref. Renamed
Emulator::TakeName to Utility::TakeName (this is internal use only,
so there should be no public impact).
.IP "v1.000.15 \- 2001/12/01" 4
.IX Item "v1.000.15 - 2001/12/01"
Adjusted Template::Universal's code for _CALL_METHODS_FROM_HASH_,
to ensure that method/arg pairs are called in order they were passed
in.
.IP "v1.000.15 \- 2001/07/04, 2001/07/19" 4
.IX Item "v1.000.15 - 2001/07/04, 2001/07/19"

.IP "v1.000.14 \- 2001/06/25, 2001/06/29, 2001/07/01" 4
.IX Item "v1.000.14 - 2001/06/25, 2001/06/29, 2001/07/01"
Removed Makefile rule from Makefile.PL to avoid warnings when used
with recent versions of ExtUtils::MakeMaker, which also define a
similar rule. (Based on bug report from Ron Savage.)
.Sp
Fixed test failure for machines with P5.6 but no Attribute::Handlers.
(Reported by Ron Savage, Jay Lawrence.)
.Sp
Added Template::Flyweight:string_index. (But still needs test
script.)
.Sp
Added Standard::Universal. (But still needs test scripts.)
.Sp
Minor touch-ups to ReadMe and Guide documentation.
.IP "v1.000.13 \- 2001/05/16, 2001/05/18, 2001/05/20, 2001/06/02, 2001/06/22, 2001/06/24" 4

To date, this module has been circulated under several provisional
names: it was originally floated as a possible version\-2 rewrite
of Class::MethodMaker, then renamed to Class::Methods when it forked
from that project, and then briefly to Class::MethodGenerator.
(Note that it can be surprisingly difficult to comply with both of
these perlmodlib guidelines: \*(L"To be portable each component of
a module name should be limited   to 11 characters. [...] Always
try to use two or more whole words.\*(R") In the end, I selected
Class::MakeMethods, as it is two whole words, and is reminiscent
of Class::MethodMaker without being confusing (I hope!), and I
believe this issue is now settled.
.Sp
Standardized syntax for global options; renamed \-implementation to
\&\-MakerClass and \-target_class to \-TargetClass. Moved \f(CW$TargetClass\fR
and other context information into \f(CW%CONTEXT\fR with _context accessor.
Added ForceInstall.
.Sp
Completed re-simplification of build directories; we're back to a
single Makefile, which avoids a warning in P5.6.0.
.Sp
Added Attribute interface for use with P5.6 and later, based on
Attribute::Handlers.
.Sp
Renamed \*(L"Simple\*(R" subclasses to \*(L"Basic\*(R". Added documentation and
initial tests.
.Sp
Added Standard subclasses with parameter parsing and more powerful
accessors.
.Sp
Modified Emulator::Struct to use Standard::* methods. Found struct
test from P5.7, and added auto_init functionality to match.
.Sp
Added Composite::* subclasses.
.Sp
Added Emulator::AccessorFast.
.Sp
Added Class::MakeMethods::Guide with introduction and examples.
.Sp
Continued clean-up effort on Template documentation. Renamed Template
\&\*(L"attributes\*(R" to \*(L"method parameters\*(R" to avoid confusion with Perl
attributes. Retitled Template naming rules from \*(L"templates\*(R" to
\&\*(L"interfaces\*(R".
.Sp
Changed initialization code expressions of Template::Class in hopes
of P5.6.1 compatibility. (Problem reported by M Schwern.)
.Sp
Added 'Template::Generic:new \-\-and_then_init' based on feedback
from Jay Lawrence.
.SS "Early 1.000 versions"

.IP "v1.000.12 \- 2001/05/14" 4
.IX Item "v1.000.12 - 2001/05/14"
Renamed module to Class::MethodGenerator, although naming questions
remain.
.Sp
Moved Template subclasses into Template::* namespace. Simplified
build directory and makefile structure.
.Sp
Changed initialization code expressions of Template::PackageVar,
ClassVar for P5.6.0 compatibility. (Reported by M Schwern.)

Moved _namespace_capture and _namespace_release to Class::Methods::Base.
.Sp
Additional doc tweakage. Moved ReadMe documentation to
Bundle::ClassMethods. Merged Extending documentation into Base.
.Sp
Removed spurious uses of \-default => 'default' in templates.
.Sp
Added new ClassInherit subclass and Emulator::Inheritable.
.Sp
Expunged Index subclass in favor of boolean_index and string_index
types on Generic.
.Sp
Moved Struct:builtin_isa type to new package, StructBuiltin.
.Sp
Refactored code templating function as Class::Methods::Base::TextBuilder.
.IP "v1.000.9 \- 2001/03/24" 4
.IX Item "v1.000.9 - 2001/03/24"
Reversed sense of \- and \-\-, as it was in 1.000.1.
.Sp
Separated source files into separate directories with distinct
Makefiles and test hierarchies. This should clarify the boundaries
between the core method-generation code, the common constructor/accessor
methods, and the various emulator and experimental packages.
.IP "v1.000.8 \- 2001/01/19" 4
.IX Item "v1.000.8 - 2001/01/19"
Following receipt of a suggestion to fork from the maintainer of
Class::MethodMaker, renamed packge from Class::MethodMaker v2.0 to
Class::Methods v1.000.
.Sp
Adjusted documentation to reflect fork, although additional cleanup
is still needed.
.Sp
Moved backward compatibility to Emulator::MethodMaker subclass.
.Sp
Added Generic \-compatibility array index_* and hash_of_arrays *_last
and *_set methods to match changes in Class::MethodMaker v1.02.
Added Emulator::MethodMaker support for the '\-static' flag. The
emulator now completely satisfies the enclosed test suites, from
Class::MethodMaker v0.92 and v1.02.
.IP "v1.000.7 \- 2001/01/05, 2001/01/06, 2001/01/07" 4
.IX Item "v1.000.7 - 2001/01/05, 2001/01/06, 2001/01/07"
Moved core code and internal code to Internals.pm. MethodMaker.pm
now contains only some require statements and the general user
guide documentation.
.Sp
Moved ReadMe.pod, Changes.pod, and ToDo.pod into MethodMaker
directory. Separated Catalog.pod, Extending.pod, RelatedModules.pod.
.Sp
Included version 1 docs as Class::Methods::OriginalDocs; minor
revisions for clarity.
.Sp
Renamed Package subclass to PackageVar, Class to ClassVar.
.Sp
Added Emulation::Struct subclass.
.Sp
Added support for shifting targets with make( \-target_class =>
Package, ... ).
