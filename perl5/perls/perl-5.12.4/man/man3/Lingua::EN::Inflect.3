.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The exportable subroutines of Lingua::EN::Inflect provide plural
inflections, \*(L"a\*(R"/\*(L"an\*(R" selection for English words, and manipulation
of numbers as words
.PP
Plural forms of all nouns, most verbs, and some adjectives are
provided. Where appropriate, \*(L"classical\*(R" variants (for example: \*(L"brother\*(R" \->
\&\*(L"brethren\*(R", \*(L"dogma\*(R" \-> \*(L"dogmata\*(R", etc.) are also provided.
.PP
Pronunciation-based \*(L"a\*(R"/\*(L"an\*(R" selection is provided for all English
words, and most initialisms.
.PP
It is also possible to inflect numerals (1,2,3) to ordinals (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
and to english words (\*(L"one\*(R", \*(L"two\*(R", "three).
.PP
In generating these inflections, Lingua::EN::Inflect follows the Oxford
English Dictionary and the guidelines in Fowler's Modern English
Usage, preferring the former where the two disagree.
.PP
The module is built around standard British spelling, but is designed
to cope with common American variants as well. Slang, jargon, and
other English dialects are \fInot\fR explicitly catered for.
.PP
Where two or more inflected forms exist for a single word (typically a
\&\*(L"classical\*(R" form and a \*(L"modern\*(R" form), Lingua::EN::Inflect prefers the
more common form (typically the \*(L"modern\*(R" one), unless \*(L"classical\*(R"
processing has been specified
(see \*(L"\s-1MODERN\s0 \s-1VS\s0 \s-1CLASSICAL\s0 \s-1INFLECTIONS\s0\*(R").
.SH "FORMING PLURALS"
.IX Header "FORMING PLURALS"
.SS "Inflecting Plurals"
.IX Subsection "Inflecting Plurals"
All of the \f(CW\*(C`PL_...\*(C'\fR plural inflection subroutines take the word to be
inflected as their first argument and return the corresponding inflection.
Note that all such subroutines expect the \fIsingular\fR form of the word. The
results of passing a plural form are undefined (and unlikely to be correct).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`PL_...\*(C'\fR subroutines also take an optional second argument,
which indicates the grammatical \*(L"number\*(R" of the word (or of another word
with which the word being inflected must agree). If the \*(L"number\*(R" argument is
supplied and is not \f(CW1\fR (or \f(CW"one"\fR or \f(CW"a"\fR, or some other adjective that
implies the singular), the plural form of the word is returned. If the
\&\*(L"number\*(R" argument \fIdoes\fR indicate singularity, the (uninflected) word
itself is returned. If the number argument is omitted, the plural form
is returned unconditionally.
.PP
The various subroutines are:
.ie n .IP """PL_N($;$)""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWPL_N($;$)\fR" 8
.IX Item "PL_N($;$)"
The exportable subroutine \f(CW\*(C`PL_N()\*(C'\fR takes a \fIsingular\fR English noun or
pronoun and returns its plural. Pronouns in the nominative (\*(L"I\*(R" \->
\&\*(L"we\*(R") and accusative (\*(L"me\*(R" \-> \*(L"us\*(R") cases are handled, as are
possessive pronouns (\*(L"mine\*(R" \-> \*(L"ours\*(R").
.ie n .IP """PL_V($;$)""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWPL_V($;$)\fR" 8
.IX Item "PL_V($;$)"
The exportable subroutine \f(CW\*(C`PL_V()\*(C'\fR takes the \fIsingular\fR form of a
conjugated verb (that is, one which is already in the correct \*(L"person\*(R"
and \*(L"mood\*(R") and returns the corresponding plural conjugation.
.ie n .IP """PL_ADJ($;$)""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWPL_ADJ($;$)\fR" 8
.IX Item "PL_ADJ($;$)"
The exportable subroutine \f(CW\*(C`PL_ADJ()\*(C'\fR takes the \fIsingular\fR form of
certain types of adjectives and returns the corresponding plural form.
Adjectives that are correctly handled include: \*(L"numerical\*(R" adjectives
(\*(L"a\*(R" \-> \*(L"some\*(R"), demonstrative adjectives (\*(L"this\*(R" \-> \*(L"these\*(R", \*(L"that\*(R" \->
\&\*(L"those\*(R"), and possessives (\*(L"my\*(R" \-> \*(L"our\*(R", \*(L"cat's\*(R" \-> \*(L"cats'\*(R", \*(L"child's\*(R"
\&\-> \*(L"childrens'\*(R", etc.)
.ie n .IP """PL($;$)""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWPL($;$)\fR" 8
.IX Item "PL($;$)"
The exportable subroutine \f(CW\*(C`PL()\*(C'\fR takes a \fIsingular\fR English noun,
pronoun, verb, or adjective and returns its plural form. Where a word
has more than one inflection depending on its part of speech (for
example, the noun \*(L"thought\*(R" inflects to \*(L"thoughts\*(R", the verb \*(L"thought\*(R"
to \*(L"thought\*(R"), the (singular) noun sense is preferred to the (singular)
verb sense.
.Sp
Hence \f(CW\*(C`PL("knife")\*(C'\fR will return \*(L"knives\*(R" (\*(L"knife\*(R" having been treated
as a singular noun), whereas \f(CW\*(C`PL("knifes")\*(C'\fR will return \*(L"knife\*(R"
(\*(L"knifes\*(R" having been treated as a 3rd person singular verb).
.Sp
The inherent ambiguity of such cases suggests that,
where the part of speech is known, \f(CW\*(C`PL_N\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PL_V\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`PL_ADJ\*(C'\fR should be used in preference to \f(CW\*(C`PL\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Note that all these subroutines ignore any whitespace surrounding the
word being inflected, but preserve that whitespace when the result is
returned. For example, \f(CW\*(C`PL("\ cat\ \ ")\*(C'\fR returns \*(L"\ cats\ \ \*(R".
.SS "Numbered plurals"
.IX Subsection "Numbered plurals"
The \f(CW\*(C`PL_...\*(C'\fR subroutines return only the inflected word, not the count that
was used to inflect it. Thus, in order to produce \*(L"I saw 3 ducks\*(R", it
is necessary to use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print "I saw $N ", PL_N($animal,$N), "\en";
.Ve
.PP
Since the usual purpose of producing a plural is to make it agree with
a preceding count, Lingua::EN::Inflect provides an exportable subroutine
(\f(CW\*(C`NO($;$)\*(C'\fR) which, given a word and a(n optional) count, returns the
count followed by the correctly inflected word. Hence the previous
example can be rewritten:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print "I saw ", NO($animal,$N), "\en";
.Ve
.PP
In addition, if the count is zero (or some other term which implies
zero, such as \f(CW"zero"\fR, \f(CW"nil"\fR, etc.) the count is replaced by the
word \*(L"no\*(R". Hence, if \f(CW$N\fR had the value zero, the previous example
would print the somewhat more elegant:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    I saw no animals
.Ve
.PP
rather than:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    I saw 0 animals
.Ve
.PP
Note that the name of the subroutine is a pun: the subroutine
returns either a number (a \fINo.\fR) or a \f(CW"no"\fR, in front of the
inflected word.
.SS "Reducing the number of counts required"
.IX Subsection "Reducing the number of counts required"
In some contexts, the need to supply an explicit count to the various
\&\f(CW\*(C`PL_...\*(C'\fR subroutines makes for tiresome repetition. For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    print PL_ADJ("This",$errors), PL_N(" error",$errors),
\&          PL_V(" was",$errors), " fatal.\en";
.Ve
.PP
Lingua::EN::Inflect therefore provides an exportable subroutine
(\f(CW\*(C`NUM($;$)\*(C'\fR) which may be used to set a persistent \*(L"default number\*(R"
value. If such a value is set, it is subsequently used whenever an
optional second \*(L"number\*(R" argument is omitted. The default value thus set 
can subsequently be removed by calling \f(CW\*(C`NUM()\*(C'\fR with no arguments.
Hence we could rewrite the previous example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    NUM($errors);
\&    print PL_ADJ("This"), PL_N(" error"), PL_V(" was"), "fatal.\en";
\&    NUM();
.Ve
.PP
Normally, \f(CW\*(C`NUM()\*(C'\fR returns its first argument, so that it may also
be \*(L"inlined\*(R" in contexts like:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    print NUM($errors), PL_N(" error"), PL_V(" was"), " detected.\en"
\&    print PL_ADJ("This"), PL_N(" error"), PL_V(" was"), "fatal.\en"
\&        if $severity > 1;
.Ve
.PP
However, in certain contexts (see \*(L"\s-1INTERPOLATING\s0 \s-1INFLECTIONS\s0 \s-1IN\s0 \s-1STRINGS\s0\*(R")
it is preferable that \f(CW\*(C`NUM()\*(C'\fR return an empty string. Hence \f(CW\*(C`NUM()\*(C'\fR
provides an optional second argument. If that argument is supplied (that is, if
it is defined) and evaluates to false, \f(CW\*(C`NUM\*(C'\fR returns an empty string
instead of its first argument. For example:
.PP
.Vb 3

Lingua::EN::Inflect also provides a solution to the problem
of comparing words of differing plurality through the exportable subroutines
\&\f(CW\*(C`PL_eq($$)\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PL_N_eq($$)\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PL_V_eq($$)\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`PL_ADJ_eq($$)\*(C'\fR.
Each  of these subroutines takes two strings, and  compares them
using the corresponding plural-inflection subroutine (\f(CW\*(C`PL()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PL_N()\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`PL_V()\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`PL_ADJ()\*(C'\fR respectively).
.PP
The comparison returns true if:
.IP "\(bu" 8
the strings are \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR\-equal, or
.IP "\(bu" 8
one string is \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR\-equal to a plural form of the other, or
.IP "\(bu" 8
the strings are two different plural forms of the one word.
.PP
Hence all of the following return true:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    PL_eq("index","index")      # RETURNS "eq"
\&    PL_eq("index","indexes")    # RETURNS "s:p"
\&    PL_eq("index","indices")    # RETURNS "s:p"
\&    PL_eq("indexes","index")    # RETURNS "p:s"
\&    PL_eq("indices","index")    # RETURNS "p:s"
\&    PL_eq("indices","indexes")  # RETURNS "p:p"
\&    PL_eq("indexes","indices")  # RETURNS "p:p"
\&    PL_eq("indices","indices")  # RETURNS "eq"
.Ve
.PP
As indicated by the comments in the previous example, the actual value
returned by the various \f(CW\*(C`PL_eq\*(C'\fR subroutines encodes which of the
three equality rules succeeded: \*(L"eq\*(R" is returned if the strings were
identical, \*(L"s:p\*(R" if the strings were singular and plural respectively,
\&\*(L"p:s\*(R" for plural and singular, and \*(L"p:p\*(R" for two distinct plurals.
Inequality is indicated by returning an empty string.
.PP
It should be noted that two distinct singular words which happen to take
the same plural form are \fInot\fR considered equal, nor are cases where
one (singular) word's plural is the other (plural) word's singular.
Hence all of the following return false:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    PL_eq("base","basis")       # ALTHOUGH BOTH \-> "bases"
\&    PL_eq("syrinx","syringe")   # ALTHOUGH BOTH \-> "syringes"
\&    PL_eq("she","he")       # ALTHOUGH BOTH \-> "they"
\&
\&    PL_eq("opus","operas")      # ALTHOUGH "opus" \-> "opera" \-> "operas"
\&    PL_eq("taxi","taxes")       # ALTHOUGH "taxi" \-> "taxis" \-> "taxes"
.Ve
.PP
Note too that, although the comparison is \*(L"number-insensitive\*(R" it is \fInot\fR
case-insensitive (that is, \f(CW\*(C`PL("time","Times")\*(C'\fR returns false. To obtain
both number and case insensitivity, prefix both arguments with \f(CW\*(C`lc\*(C'\fR
(that is, \f(CW\*(C`PL(lc "time", lc "Times")\*(C'\fR returns true).

Lingua::EN::Inflect provides two exportable subroutines (\f(CW\*(C`A($;$)\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`AN($;$)\*(C'\fR) which will correctly prepend the appropriate indefinite
article to a word, depending on its pronunciation. For example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    A("cat")        # \-> "a cat"
\&    AN("cat")       # \-> "a cat"
\&    A("euphemism")      # \-> "a euphemism"
\&    A("Euler number")   # \-> "an Euler number"
\&    A("hour")       # \-> "an hour"
\&    A("houri")      # \-> "a houri"
.Ve
.PP
The two subroutines are \fIidentical\fR in function and may be used
interchangeably. The only reason that two versions are provided is to
enhance the readability of code such as:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    print "That is ", AN($errortype), " error\en;
\&    print "That is ", A($fataltype), " fatal error\en;
.Ve
.PP
Note that in both cases the actual article provided depends \fIonly\fR on
the pronunciation of the first argument, \fInot\fR on the name of the
subroutine.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`A()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`AN()\*(C'\fR will ignore any indefinite article that already
exists at the start of the string. Thus:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    @half_arked = (
\&        "a elephant",
\&        "a giraffe",
\&        "an ewe",
\&        "a orangutan",
\&    );
\&
\&    print A($_), "\en" for @half_arked;
\&
\&    # prints:
\&    #     an elephant
\&    #     a giraffe
\&    #     a ewe
\&    #     an orangutan
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`A()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`AN()\*(C'\fR both take an optional second argument. As with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`PL_...\*(C'\fR subroutines, this second argument is a \*(L"number\*(R" specifier. If
its value is \f(CW1\fR (or some other value implying singularity), \f(CW\*(C`A()\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`AN()\*(C'\fR insert \*(L"a\*(R" or \*(L"an\*(R" as appropriate. If the number specifier 
implies plurality, (\f(CW\*(C`A()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`AN()\*(C'\fR insert the actual second argument instead.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    A("cat",1)      # \-> "a cat"
\&    A("cat",2)      # \-> "2 cat"
\&    A("cat","one")      # \-> "one cat"
\&    A("cat","no")       # \-> "no cat"
.Ve
.PP
Note that, as implied by the previous examples, \f(CW\*(C`A()\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`AN()\*(C'\fR both assume that their job is merely to provide the correct
qualifier for a word (that is: \*(L"a\*(R", \*(L"an\*(R", or the specified count).
In other words, they assume that the word they are given has
already been correctly inflected for plurality. Hence, if \f(CW$N\fR 
has the value 2, then:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&      print A("cat",$N);
.Ve
.PP
prints \*(L"2 cat\*(R", instead of \*(L"2 cats\*(R". The correct approach is to use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&      print A(PL("cat",$N),$N);
.Ve
.PP
or, better still:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&      print NO("cat",$N);
.Ve
.PP
Note too that, like the various \f(CW\*(C`PL_...\*(C'\fR subroutines, whenever \f(CW\*(C`A()\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`AN()\*(C'\fR are called with only one argument they are subject to the
effects of any preceding call to \f(CW\*(C`NUM()\*(C'\fR. Hence, another possible
solution is:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&      NUM($N);
\&      print A(PL("cat"));
.Ve
.SS "Indefinite articles and initialisms"
.IX Subsection "Indefinite articles and initialisms"
\&\*(L"Initialisms\*(R" (sometimes inaccurately called \*(L"acronyms\*(R") are terms which
have been formed from the initial letters of words in a phrase (for
example, \*(L"\s-1NATO\s0\*(R", \*(L"\s-1NBL\s0\*(R", \*(L"S.O.S.\*(R", \*(L"\s-1SCUBA\s0\*(R", etc.)
.PP
Such terms present a particular challenge when selecting between \*(L"a\*(R"
and \*(L"an\*(R", since they are sometimes pronounced as if they were a single
word (\*(L"nay-tow\*(R", \*(L"sku-ba\*(R") and sometimes as a series of letter names
(\*(L"en-eff-ell\*(R", \*(L"ess-oh-ess\*(R").
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`A()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`AN()\*(C'\fR cope with this dichotomy using a series of inbuilt
rules, which may be summarized as:
.IP "1." 8
If the word starts with a single letter, followed by a period or dash
(for example, \*(L"R.I.P.\*(R", \*(L"C.O.D.\*(R", \*(L"e\-mail\*(R", \*(L"X\-ray\*(R", \*(L"T\-square\*(R"), then
choose the appropriate article for the \fIsound\fR of the first letter
(\*(L"an R.I.P.\*(R", \*(L"a C.O.D.\*(R", \*(L"an e\-mail\*(R", \*(L"an X\-ray\*(R", \*(L"a T\-square\*(R").
.IP "2." 8
If the first two letters of the word are capitals,
consonants, and do not appear at the start of any known English word,
(for example, \*(L"\s-1LCD\s0\*(R", \*(L"\s-1XML\s0\*(R", \*(L"\s-1YWCA\s0\*(R"), then once again choose \*(L"a\*(R" or
\&\*(L"an\*(R" depending on the \fIsound\fR of the first letter (\*(L"an \s-1LCD\s0\*(R", \*(L"an
\&\s-1XML\s0\*(R", \*(L"a \s-1YWCA\s0\*(R").
.IP "3." 8
Otherwise, assume the string is a capitalized word or a
pronounceable initialism (for example, \*(L"\s-1LED\s0\*(R", \*(L"\s-1OPEC\s0\*(R", \*(L"\s-1FAQ\s0\*(R", \*(L"\s-1UNESCO\s0\*(R"), and
therefore takes \*(L"a\*(R" or \*(L"an\*(R" according to the (apparent) pronunciation of
the entire word (\*(L"a \s-1LED\s0\*(R", \*(L"an \s-1OPEC\s0\*(R", \*(L"a \s-1FAQ\s0\*(R", \*(L"a \s-1UNESCO\s0\*(R").
.PP
Note that rules 1 and 3 together imply that the presence or absence of
punctuation may change the selection of indefinite article for a
particular initialism (for example, \*(L"a \s-1FAQ\s0\*(R" but \*(L"an F.A.Q.\*(R").
.ie n .SS "Indefinite articles and ""soft H's"""
.el .SS "Indefinite articles and ``soft H's''"
.IX Subsection "Indefinite articles and soft H's"
Words beginning in the letter 'H' present another type of difficulty
when selecting a suitable indefinite article. In a few such words
(for example, \*(L"hour\*(R", \*(L"honour\*(R", \*(L"heir\*(R") the 'H' is not voiced at
all, and so such words inflect with \*(L"an\*(R". The remaining cases
(\*(L"voiced H's\*(R") may be divided into two categories:
\&\*(L"hard H's\*(R" (such as \*(L"hangman\*(R", \*(L"holograph\*(R", \*(L"hat\*(R", etc.) and
\&\*(L"soft H's\*(R" (such as \*(L"hysterical\*(R", \*(L"horrendous\*(R", \*(L"holy\*(R", etc.)
.PP
Hard H's always take \*(L"a\*(R" as their indefinite article, and soft
H's normally do so as well. But \fIsome\fR English speakers prefer
\&\*(L"an\*(R" for soft H's (although the practice is now generally considered an
affectation, rather than a legitimate grammatical alternative).
.PP
At present, the \f(CW\*(C`A()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`AN()\*(C'\fR subroutines ignore soft H's and use
\&\*(L"a\*(R" for any voiced 'H'. The author would, however, welcome feedback on
this decision (envisaging a possible future \*(L"soft H\*(R" mode).
.SH "INFLECTING ORDINALS"
.IX Header "INFLECTING ORDINALS"
Occasionally it is useful to present an integer value as an ordinal
rather than as a numeral. For example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    Enter password (1st attempt): ********
\&    Enter password (2nd attempt): *********
\&    Enter password (3rd attempt): *********
\&    No 4th attempt. Access denied.
.Ve
.PP
To this end, Lingua::EN::Inflect provides the \f(CW\*(C`ORD()\*(C'\fR subroutine.
<\s-1\fIORD\s0()\fR> takes a single argument and forms its ordinal equivalent.
If the argument isn't a numerical integer, it just adds \*(L"\-th\*(R".
.SH "CONVERTING NUMBERS TO WORDS"
.IX Header "CONVERTING NUMBERS TO WORDS"
The exportable subroutine \f(CW\*(C`NUMWORDS\*(C'\fR takes a number (cardinal or ordinal)
and returns an English representation of that number. In a scalar context 
a string is returned. Hence:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Lingua::EN::Inflect qw( NUMWORDS );
\&
\&    $words = NUMWORDS(1234567);
.Ve
.PP
puts the string:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    "one million, two hundred and thirty\-four thousand, five hundred and sixty\-seven"
.Ve
.PP
into \f(CW$words\fR.
.PP
In a list context each comma-separated chunk is returned as a separate element.
Hence:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @words = NUMWORDS(1234567);
.Ve
.PP
puts the list:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    ("one million",
\&     "two hundred and thirty\-four thousand",
\&     "five hundred and sixty\-seven")
.Ve
.PP
into \f(CW@words\fR.
.PP
Non-digits (apart from an optional leading plus or minus sign,
any decimal points, and ordinal suffixes \*(-- see below) are silently
ignored, so the following all produce identical results:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        NUMWORDS(5551202);
\&        NUMWORDS(5_551_202);
\&        NUMWORDS("5,551,202");
\&        NUMWORDS("555\-1202");
.Ve
.PP
That last case is a little awkward since it's almost certainly a phone number,
and \*(L"five million, five hundred and fifty-one thousand, two hundred and two\*(R"
probably isn't what's wanted.
.PP
To overcome this, \f(CW\*(C`NUMWORDS()\*(C'\fR takes an optional named argument, 'group',
which changes how numbers are translated. The argument must be a
positive integer less than four, which indicated how the digits of the
number are to be grouped. If the argument is \f(CW1\fR, then each digit is
translated separately. If the argument is \f(CW2\fR, pairs of digits
(starting from the \fIleft\fR) are grouped together. If the argument is
\&\f(CW3\fR, triples of numbers (again, from the \fIleft\fR) are grouped. Hence:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        NUMWORDS("555\-1202", group=>1)
.Ve
.PP
returns \f(CW"five, five, five, one, two, zero, two"\fR, whilst:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        NUMWORDS("555\-1202", group=>2)
.Ve
.PP
returns \f(CW"fifty\-five, fifty\-one, twenty, two"\fR, and:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        NUMWORDS("555\-1202", group=>3)
.Ve
.PP
returns \f(CW"five fifty\-five, one twenty, two"\fR.
.PP
Phone numbers are often written in words as
\&\f(CW"five..five..five..one..two..zero..two"\fR, which is also easy to
achieve:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        join \*(Aq..\*(Aq, NUMWORDS("555\-1202", group=>1)
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`NUMWORDS\*(C'\fR also handles decimal fractions. Hence:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        NUMWORDS("1.2345")
.Ve
.PP
returns \f(CW"one point two three four five"\fR in a scalar context
and \f(CW\*(C`("one","point","two","three","four","five")\*(C'\fR) in an array context.
Exponent form (\f(CW"1.234e56"\fR) is not yet handled.
.PP
Multiple decimal points are only translated in one of the \*(L"grouping\*(R" modes.
Hence:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        NUMWORDS(101.202.303)
.Ve
.PP
returns \f(CW"one hundred and one point two zero two three zero three"\fR,
whereas:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        NUMWORDS(101.202.303, group=>1)
.Ve
.PP
returns \f(CW"one zero one point two zero two point three zero three"\fR.
.PP
The digit \f(CW\*(Aq0\*(Aq\fR is unusual in that in may be translated to English as \*(L"zero\*(R",
\&\*(L"oh\*(R", or \*(L"nought\*(R". To cater for this diversity, \f(CW\*(C`NUMWORDS\*(C'\fR may be passed
a named argument, 'zero', which may be set to
the desired translation of \f(CW\*(Aq0\*(Aq\fR. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        print join "..", NUMWORDS("555\-1202", group=>3, zero=>\*(Aqoh\*(Aq)
.Ve
.PP
prints \f(CW"five..five..five..one..two..oh..two"\fR.
By default, zero is rendered as \*(L"zero\*(R".
.PP
Likewise, the digit \f(CW\*(Aq1\*(Aq\fR may be rendered as \*(L"one\*(R" or \*(L"a/an\*(R" (or very
occasionally other variants), depending on the context. So there is a
\&\f(CW\*(Aqone\*(Aq\fR argument as well:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        print NUMWORDS($_, one=>\*(Aqa solitary\*(Aq, zero=>\*(Aqno more\*(Aq),
\&              PL(" bottle of beer on the wall\en", $_)
\&                   for (3,2,1,0);
\&
\&        # prints:
\&        #     three bottles of beer on the wall
\&        #     two bottles of beer on the wall
\&        #     a solitary bottle of beer on the wall
\&        #     no more bottles of beer on the wall
.Ve
.PP
Care is needed if the word \*(L"a/an\*(R" is to be used as a \f(CW\*(Aqone\*(Aq\fR value.
Unless the next word is known in advance, it's almost always necessary
to use the \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR function as well:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        print A( NUMWORDS(1, one=>\*(Aqa\*(Aq) . " $_\en")
\&         for qw(cat aardvark ewe hour);   
\&
\&    # prints:
\&    #     a cat
\&    #     an aardvark
\&    #     a ewe
\&    #     an hour
.Ve
.PP
Another major regional variation in number translation is the use of
\&\*(L"and\*(R" in certain contexts. The named argument 'and'
allows the programmer to specify how \*(L"and\*(R" should be handled. Hence:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        print scalar NUMWORDS("765", \*(Aqand\*(Aq=>\*(Aq\*(Aq)
.Ve
.PP
prints \*(L"seven hundred sixty-five\*(R", instead of \*(L"seven hundred and sixty-five\*(R".
By default, the \*(L"and\*(R" is included.
.PP
The translation of the decimal point is also subject to variation
(with \*(L"point\*(R", \*(L"dot\*(R", and \*(L"decimal\*(R" being the favorites).
The named argument 'decimal' allows the
programmer to how the decimal point should be rendered. Hence:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        print scalar NUMWORDS("666.124.64.101", group=>3, decimal=>\*(Aqdot\*(Aq)
.Ve
.PP
prints \*(L"six sixty-six, dot, one twenty-four, dot, sixty-four, dot, one zero one\*(R"
By default, the decimal point is rendered as \*(L"point\*(R".
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`NUMWORDS\*(C'\fR also handles the ordinal forms of numbers. So:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        print scalar NUMWORDS(\*(Aq1st\*(Aq);
\&        print scalar NUMWORDS(\*(Aq3rd\*(Aq);
\&        print scalar NUMWORDS(\*(Aq202nd\*(Aq);
\&        print scalar NUMWORDS(\*(Aq1000000th\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
print:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        first
\&        third
\&        two hundred and twenty\-second
\&        one millionth
.Ve
.PP
Two common idioms in this regard are:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        print scalar NUMWORDS(ORD($number));
.Ve
.PP
and:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        print scalar ORD(NUMWORDS($number));
.Ve
.PP
These are identical in effect, except when \f(CW$number\fR contains a decimal:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        $number = 99.09;
\&        print scalar NUMWORDS(ORD($number));    # ninety\-ninth point zero nine
\&        print scalar ORD(NUMWORDS($number));    # ninety\-nine point zero ninth
.Ve
.PP
Use whichever you feel is most appropriate.
.SH "CONVERTING LISTS OF WORDS TO PHRASES"
.IX Header "CONVERTING LISTS OF WORDS TO PHRASES"
When creating a list of words, commas are used between adjacent items,
except if the items contain commas, in which case semicolons are used.
But if there are less than two items, the commas/semicolons are omitted
entirely. The final item also has a conjunction (usually \*(L"and\*(R" or \*(L"or\*(R")
before it. And although it's technically incorrect (and sometimes
misleading), some people prefer to omit the comma before that final
conjunction, even when there are more than two items.
.PP
That's complicated enough to warrant its own subroutine: \f(CW\*(C`WORDLIST()\*(C'\fR.
This subroutine expects a list of words, possibly with one or more hash
references containing options. It returns a string that joins the list
together in the normal English usage. For example:
.PP
.Vb 2

\&    # You chose barley soup, roast beef, and Yorkshire pudding
\&
\&    print "You chose ", WORDLIST(@selected_items, {final_sep=>""}), "\en";
\&    # You chose barley soup, roast beef and Yorkshire pudding
\&
\&    print "Please chose ", WORDLIST(@side_orders, {conj=>"or"}), "\en";
\&    # Please chose salad, vegetables, or ice\-cream

.Ve
.SH "INTERPOLATING INFLECTIONS IN STRINGS"
.IX Header "INTERPOLATING INFLECTIONS IN STRINGS"
By far the commonest use of the inflection subroutines is to
produce message strings for various purposes. For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        print NUM($errors), PL_N(" error"), PL_V(" was"), " detected.\en";
\&        print PL_ADJ("This"), PL_N(" error"), PL_V(" was"), "fatal.\en"
\&                if $severity > 1;

Unfortunately the need to separate each subroutine call detracts
significantly from the readability of the resulting code. To ameliorate
this problem, Lingua::EN::Inflect provides an exportable string-interpolating
subroutine (\f(CWinflect($)\fR), which recognizes calls to the various inflection
subroutines within a string and interpolates them appropriately.

Note that \f(CW\*(C`inflect\*(C'\fR also correctly handles calls to the \f(CW\*(C`NUM()\*(C'\fR subroutine
(whether interpolated or antecedent). The \f(CW\*(C`inflect()\*(C'\fR subroutine has
a related extra feature, in that it \fIautomatically\fR cancels any \*(L"default
number\*(R" value before it returns its interpolated string. This means that
calls to \f(CW\*(C`NUM()\*(C'\fR which are embedded in an \f(CW\*(C`inflect()\*(C'\fR\-interpolated
string do not \*(L"escape\*(R" and interfere with subsequent inflections.
.SH "MODERN VS CLASSICAL INFLECTIONS"
.IX Header "MODERN VS CLASSICAL INFLECTIONS"
Certain words, mainly of Latin or Ancient Greek origin, can form
plurals either using the standard English \*(L"\-s\*(R" suffix, or with 
their original Latin or Greek inflections. For example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        PL("stigma")            # \-> "stigmas" or "stigmata"
\&        PL("torus")             # \-> "toruses" or "tori"
\&        PL("index")             # \-> "indexes" or "indices"
\&        PL("millennium")        # \-> "millenniums" or "millennia"
\&        PL("ganglion")          # \-> "ganglions" or "ganglia"
\&        PL("octopus")           # \-> "octopuses" or "octopodes"
.Ve
.PP
Lingua::EN::Inflect caters to such words by providing an
\&\*(L"alternate state\*(R" of inflection known as \*(L"classical mode\*(R".
By default, words are inflected using their contemporary English
plurals, but if classical mode is invoked, the more traditional 
plural forms are returned instead.
.PP
The exportable subroutine \f(CW\*(C`classical()\*(C'\fR controls this feature.
If \f(CW\*(C`classical()\*(C'\fR is called with no arguments, it unconditionally
invokes classical mode. If it is called with a single argument, it
turns all classical inflects on or off (depending on whether the argument is
true or false). If called with two or more arguments, those arguments 
specify which aspects of classical behaviour are to be used.
.PP
Thus:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        classical;                  # SWITCH ON CLASSICAL MODE
\&        print PL("formula");        # \-> "formulae"
\&
\&        classical 0;                # SWITCH OFF CLASSICAL MODE
\&        print PL("formula");        # \-> "formulas"
\&
\&        classical $cmode;           # CLASSICAL MODE IFF $cmode
\&        print PL("formula");        # \-> "formulae" (IF $cmode)
\&                                    # \-> "formulas" (OTHERWISE)
\&
\&        classical herd=>1;          # SWITCH ON CLASSICAL MODE FOR "HERD" NOUNS
\&        print PL("wilderbeest");    # \-> "wilderbeest"
\&
\&        classical names=>1;         # SWITCH ON CLASSICAL MODE FOR NAMES
\&        print PL("sally");          # \-> "sallies"
\&        print PL("Sally");          # \-> "Sallys"
.Ve
.PP
Note however that \f(CW\*(C`classical()\*(C'\fR has no effect on the inflection of words which
are now fully assimilated. Hence:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        PL("forum")             # ALWAYS \-> "forums"
\&        PL("criterion")         # ALWAYS \-> "criteria"
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1LEI\s0 assumes that a capitalized word is a person's name. So it forms the
plural according to the rules for names (which is that you don't
inflect, you just add \-s or \-es). You can choose to turn that behaviour
off (it's on by the default, even when the module isn't in classical
mode) by calling \f(CW\*(C`classical(names=>0)\*(C'\fR.
.SH "USER-DEFINED INFLECTIONS"
.IX Header "USER-DEFINED INFLECTIONS"
.SS "Adding plurals at run-time"
.IX Subsection "Adding plurals at run-time"
Lingua::EN::Inflect provides five exportable subroutines which allow
the programmer to override the module's behaviour for specific cases:
.ie n .IP """def_noun($$)""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWdef_noun($$)\fR" 8
.IX Item "def_noun($$)"
The \f(CW\*(C`def_noun\*(C'\fR subroutine takes a pair of string arguments: the singular and
plural forms of the noun being specified. The singular form 
specifies a pattern to be interpolated (as \f(CW\*(C`m/^(?:$first_arg)$/i\*(C'\fR).
Any noun matching this pattern is then replaced by the string in the
second argument. The second argument specifies a string which is
interpolated after the match succeeds, and is then used as the plural
form. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&      def_noun  \*(Aqcow\*(Aq        => \*(Aqkine\*(Aq;
\&      def_noun  \*(Aq(.+i)o\*(Aq     => \*(Aq$1i\*(Aq;
\&      def_noun  \*(Aqspam(mer)?\*(Aq => \*(Aq\e\e$\e\e%\e\e@#\e\e$\e\e@#!!\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
Note that both arguments should usually be specified in single quotes,
so that they are not interpolated when they are specified, but later (when
words are compared to them). As indicated by the last example, care
also needs to be taken with certain characters in the second argument,
to ensure that they are not unintentionally interpolated during comparison.
.Sp
The second argument string may also specify a second variant of the plural
form, to be used when \*(L"classical\*(R" plurals have been requested. The beginning
of the second variant is marked by a '|' character:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&      def_noun  \*(Aqcow\*(Aq        => \*(Aqcows|kine\*(Aq;
\&      def_noun  \*(Aq(.+i)o\*(Aq     => \*(Aq$1os|$1i\*(Aq;
\&      def_noun  \*(Aqspam(mer)?\*(Aq => \*(Aq\e\e$\e\e%\e\e@#\e\e$\e\e@#!!|varmints\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
If no classical variant is given, the specified plural form is used in
both normal and \*(L"classical\*(R" modes.
.Sp
If the second argument is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR instead of a string, then the
current user definition for the first argument is removed, and the
standard plural inflection(s) restored.
.Sp
Note that in all cases, later plural definitions for a particular
singular form replace earlier definitions of the same form. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&      # FIRST, HIDE THE MODERN FORM....
\&      def_noun  \*(Aqaviatrix\*(Aq => \*(Aqaviatrices\*(Aq;
\&
\&      # LATER, HIDE THE CLASSICAL FORM...
\&      def_noun  \*(Aqaviatrix\*(Aq => \*(Aqaviatrixes\*(Aq;
\&
\&      # FINALLY, RESTORE THE DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR...
\&      def_noun  \*(Aqaviatrix\*(Aq => undef;
.Ve
.Sp
Special care is also required when defining general patterns and
associated specific exceptions: put the more specific cases \fIafter\fR
the general pattern. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&      def_noun  \*(Aq(.+)us\*(Aq => \*(Aq$1i\*(Aq;      # EVERY "\-us" TO "\-i"
\&      def_noun  \*(Aqbus\*(Aq    => \*(Aqbuses\*(Aq;    # EXCEPT FOR "bus"
.Ve
.Sp
This \*(L"try-most-recently-defined-first\*(R" approach to matching
user-defined words is also used by \f(CW\*(C`def_verb\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`def_a\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`def_an\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP """def_verb($$$$$$)""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWdef_verb($$$$$$)\fR" 8
.IX Item "def_verb($$$$$$)"
The \f(CW\*(C`def_verb\*(C'\fR subroutine takes three pairs of string arguments (that is, six
arguments in total), specifying the singular and plural forms of the three
\&\*(L"persons\*(R" of verb. As with \f(CW\*(C`def_noun\*(C'\fR, the singular forms are specifications of
run-time-interpolated patterns, whilst the plural forms are specifications of
(up to two) run-time-interpolated strings:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&       def_verb \*(Aqam\*(Aq       => \*(Aqare\*(Aq,
\&                \*(Aqare\*(Aq      => \*(Aqare|art",
\&                \*(Aqis\*(Aq       => \*(Aqare\*(Aq;
\&
\&       def_verb \*(Aqhave\*(Aq     => \*(Aqhave\*(Aq,

\&                \*(Aqha(s|th)\*(Aq => \*(Aqhave\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
Note that as with \f(CW\*(C`def_noun\*(C'\fR, modern/classical variants of plurals
may be separately specified, subsequent definitions replace previous
ones, and \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR'ed plural forms revert to the standard behaviour.
.ie n .IP """def_adj($$)""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWdef_adj($$)\fR" 8
.IX Item "def_adj($$)"
The \f(CW\*(C`def_adj\*(C'\fR subroutine takes a pair of string arguments, which specify
the singular and plural forms of the adjective being defined.
As with \f(CW\*(C`def_noun\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`def_adj\*(C'\fR, the singular forms are specifications of
run-time-interpolated patterns, whilst the plural forms are specifications of
(up to two) run-time-interpolated strings:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&       def_adj  \*(Aqthis\*(Aq     => \*(Aqthese\*(Aq,
\&       def_adj  \*(Aqred\*(Aq      => \*(Aqred|gules\*(Aq,
.Ve
.Sp
As previously, modern/classical variants of plurals
may be separately specified, subsequent definitions replace previous
ones, and \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR'ed plural forms revert to the standard behaviour.
.ie n .IP "def_a($) and def_an($)" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWdef_a($)\fR and \f(CWdef_an($)\fR" 8
.IX Item "def_a($) and def_an($)"
The \f(CW\*(C`def_a\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`def_an\*(C'\fR subroutines each take a single argument, which
specifies a pattern. If a word passed to \f(CW\*(C`A()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`AN()\*(C'\fR matches this
pattern, it will be prefixed (unconditionally) with the corresponding indefinite
article. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&      def_a  \*(Aqerror\*(Aq;
\&      def_a  \*(Aqin.+\*(Aq;
\&
\&      def_an \*(Aqmistake\*(Aq;
\&      def_an \*(Aqerror\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
As with the other \f(CW\*(C`def_...\*(C'\fR subroutines, such redefinitions are sequential
in effect so that, after the above example, \*(L"error\*(R" will be inflected with \*(L"an\*(R".
.ie n .SS "The \fI\fP\fI$HOME\fP\fI/.inflectrc\fP file"
.el .SS "The \fI\fP\f(CI$HOME\fP\fI/.inflectrc\fP file"
.IX Subsection "The $HOME/.inflectrc file"
When it is imported, Lingua::EN::Inflect executes (as Perl code)
the contents of any file named \fI.inflectrc\fR which it finds in the

or in the current home directory (\f(CW$ENV{HOME}\fR), or in both.
Note that the code is executed within the Lingua::EN::Inflect
namespace.
.PP
Hence the user or the local Perl guru can make appropriate calls to
\&\f(CW\*(C`def_noun\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`def_verb\*(C'\fR, etc. in one of these \fI.inflectrc\fR files, to
permanently and universally modify the behaviour of the module. For example
.PP

\&
\&      def_a     "Euler.*";              # "Yewler" TURNS IN HIS GRAVE
.Ve
.PP
Note that calls to the \f(CW\*(C`def_...\*(C'\fR subroutines from within a program
will take precedence over the contents of the home directory
\&\fI.inflectrc\fR file, which in turn takes precedence over the system-wide
\&\fI.inflectrc\fR file.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
On loading, if the Perl code in a \fI.inflectrc\fR file is invalid

A common problem is not ending the file with something that

Using the five \f(CW\*(C`def_...\*(C'\fR subroutines directly in a program may also
result in fatal diagnostics, if a (singular) pattern or an interpolated

.SS "2nd Person precedence"
.IX Subsection "2nd Person precedence"
If a verb has identical 1st and 2nd person singular forms, but
different 1st and 2nd person plural forms, then when its plural is
constructed, the 2nd person plural form is always preferred.
.PP
The author is not currently aware of any such verbs in English, but is
not quite arrogant enough to assume \fIipso facto\fR that none exist.
.SS "Nominative precedence"
.IX Subsection "Nominative precedence"
The singular pronoun \*(L"it\*(R" presents a special problem because its plural form
can vary, depending on its \*(L"case\*(R". For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        It ate my homework       \->  They ate my homework
\&        It ate it                \->  They ate them
\&        I fed my homework to it  \->  I fed my homework to them
.Ve
.PP
As a consequence of this ambiguity, \f(CW\*(C`PL()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`PL_N\*(C'\fR have been implemented
so that they always return the \fInominative\fR plural (that is, \*(L"they\*(R").
.PP
However, when asked for the plural of an unambiguously \fIaccusative\fR
\&\*(L"it\*(R" (namely, \f(CW\*(C`PL("to it")\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PL_N("from it")\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PL("with it")\*(C'\fR,
etc.), both subroutines will correctly return the accusative plural
(\*(L"to them\*(R", \*(L"from them\*(R", \*(L"with them\*(R", etc.)
.SS "The plurality of zero"

The rules governing the choice between:

are complex and often depend more on \fIintent\fR rather than \fIcontent\fR.
Hence it is infeasible to specify such rules algorithmically.
.PP
Therefore, Lingua::EN::Text contents itself with the following compromise: If
the governing number is zero, inflections always return the plural form
unless the appropriate \*(L"classical\*(R" inflection is in effect, in which case the
singular form is always returned.
.PP
Thus, the sequence:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&      NUM(0);

produces \*(L"There were no choices\*(R", whereas:

\&      NUM(0);

.PP
it will print \*(L"There was no choice\*(R".
.SS "Homographs with heterogeneous plurals"
.IX Subsection "Homographs with heterogeneous plurals"
Another context in which intent (and not content) sometimes determines
plurality is where two distinct meanings of a word require different
plurals. For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&      Three basses were stolen from the band\*(Aqs equipment trailer.
\&      Three bass were stolen from the band\*(Aqs aquarium.
\&
\&      I put the mice next to the cheese.

\&
\&      Several thoughts about leaving crossed my mind.
\&      Several thought about leaving across my lawn.
.Ve
.PP
Lingua::EN::Inflect handles such words in two ways:
.IP "\(bu" 8
If both meanings of the word are the \fIsame\fR part of speech (for
example, \*(L"bass\*(R" is a noun in both sentences above), then one meaning
is chosen as the \*(L"usual\*(R" meaning, and only that meaning's plural is
ever returned by any of the inflection subroutines.
.IP "\(bu" 8
If each meaning of the word is a different part of speech (for
example, \*(L"thought\*(R" is both a noun and a verb), then the noun's
plural is returned by \f(CW\*(C`PL()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PL_N()\*(C'\fR and the verb's plural is
returned only by \f(CW\*(C`PL_V()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Such contexts are, fortunately, uncommon (particularly
\&\*(L"same-part-of-speech\*(R" examples). An informal study of nearly 600
\&\*(L"difficult plurals\*(R" indicates that \f(CW\*(C`PL()\*(C'\fR can be relied upon to \*(L"get
it right\*(R" about 98% of the time (although, of course, ichthyophilic
guitarists or cyber-behaviouralists may experience higher rates of
confusion).
.PP
If the choice of a particular \*(L"usual inflection\*(R" is considered
inappropriate, it can always be reversed with a preliminary call
to the corresponding \f(CW\*(C`def_...\*(C'\fR subroutine.
