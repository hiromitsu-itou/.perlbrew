.IX Title "Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::FastCGI 3"
.TH Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::FastCGI 3 "2011-08-29" "perl v5.12.4" "User Contributed Perl Documentation"

.\" way too many mistakes in technical documents.

.SH "NAME"
Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::FastCGI \- Deploying Catalyst with FastCGI
.SH "FastCGI Deployment"
.IX Header "FastCGI Deployment"
FastCGI is a high-performance extension to \s-1CGI\s0. It is suitable for production
environments, and is the standard method for deploying Catalyst in shared
hosting environments.
.SS "Pros"
.IX Subsection "Pros"
\fISpeed\fR
.IX Subsection "Speed"
.PP
FastCGI performs equally as well as mod_perl.  Don't let the '\s-1CGI\s0' fool you;
your app runs as multiple persistent processes ready to receive connections
from the web server.
.PP
\fIApp Server\fR
.IX Subsection "App Server"
.PP
When using external FastCGI servers, your application runs as a standalone
application server.  It may be restarted independently from the web server.
This allows for a more robust environment and faster reload times when
pushing new app changes.  The frontend server can even be configured to
display a friendly \*(L"down for maintenance\*(R" page while the application is
restarting.
.PP
\fILoad-balancing\fR
.IX Subsection "Load-balancing"
.PP
You can launch your application on multiple backend servers and allow
the frontend web server to perform load-balancing among all of them. And
of course, if one goes down, your app continues to run.
.PP
\fIMultiple versions of the same app\fR
.IX Subsection "Multiple versions of the same app"
.PP
Each FastCGI application is a separate process, so you can run different
versions of the same app on a single server.
.PP
\fICan run with threaded Apache\fR
.IX Subsection "Can run with threaded Apache"
.PP
Since your app is not running inside of Apache, the faster mpm_worker module
can be used without worrying about the thread safety of your application.
.PP
\fIWidely supported.\fR
.IX Subsection "Widely supported."
.PP
FastCGI is compatible with many server implementations, not just Apache.
.SS "Cons"
.IX Subsection "Cons"
You may have to disable mod_deflate.  If you experience page hangs with
mod_fastcgi then remove deflate.load and deflate.conf from mods\-enabled/
.PP
\fIMore complex environment\fR
.IX Subsection "More complex environment"
.PP
With FastCGI, there are more things to monitor and more processes running
than when using mod_perl.
.SS "Standalone FastCGI Server"
.IX Subsection "Standalone FastCGI Server"
In server mode the application runs as a standalone server and accepts
connections from a web server.  The application can be on the same machine as
the web server, on a remote machine, or even on multiple remote machines.
Advantages of this method include running the Catalyst application as a
different user than the web server, and the ability to set up a scalable
server farm.
.PP
To start your application in server mode, install the FCGI::ProcManager
module and then use the included fastcgi.pl script.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ script/myapp_fastcgi.pl \-l /tmp/myapp.socket \-n 5
.Ve
.PP
Command line options for fastcgi.pl include:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    \-d \-daemon     Daemonize the server.
\&    \-p \-pidfile    Write a pidfile with the pid of the process manager.
\&    \-l \-listen     Listen on a socket path, hostname:port, or :port.
\&    \-n \-nproc      The number of processes started to handle requests.
.Ve
.PP
See below for the specific web server configurations for using the external
server.
.SH "WEB SERVERS"
.IX Header "WEB SERVERS"
Any web server which supports FastCGI should work with Catalyst. Configuration
recipies for well-known web servers are linked below, and we would welcome
contributions from people deploying Catalyst on other web servers.
