.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\*(L"Spiffy\*(R" is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented (\s-1OO\s0)
programming in Perl. Spiffy combines the best parts of Exporter.pm,
base.pm, mixin.pm and \s-1SUPER\s0.pm into one magic foundation class. It
attempts to fix all the nits and warts of traditional Perl \s-1OO\s0, in a
clean, straightforward and (perhaps someday) standard way.
.PP
Spiffy borrows ideas from other \s-1OO\s0 languages like Python, Ruby,
Java and Perl 6. It also adds a few tricks of its own.
.PP
If you take a look on \s-1CPAN\s0, there are a ton of \s-1OO\s0 related modules. When
starting a new project, you need to pick the set of modules that makes
most sense, and then you need to use those modules in each of your
classes. Spiffy, on the other hand, has everything you'll probably need
in one module, and you only need to use it once in one of your classes.
If you make Spiffy.pm the base class of the basest class in your
project, Spiffy will automatically pass all of its magic to all of your
subclasses. You may eventually forget that you're even using it!
.PP
The most striking difference between Spiffy and other Perl object
oriented base classes, is that it has the ability to export things.
If you create a subclass of Spiffy, all the things that Spiffy
exports will automatically be exported by your subclass, in addition to
any more things that you want to export. And if someone creates a
subclass of your subclass, all of those things will be exported
automatically, and so on. Think of it as \*(L"Inherited Exportation\*(R", and it
uses the familiar Exporter.pm specification syntax.
.PP
To use Spiffy or any subclass of Spiffy as a base class of your class,
you specify the \f(CW\*(C`\-base\*(C'\fR argument to the \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR command.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use MySpiffyBaseModule \-base;
.Ve
.PP
You can also use the traditional \f(CW\*(C`use base \*(AqMySpiffyBaseModule\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR
syntax and everything will work exactly the same. The only caveat is
that Spiffy.pm must already be loaded. That's because Spiffy rewires
base.pm on the fly to do all the Spiffy magics.
.PP
Spiffy has support for Ruby-like mixins with Perl6\-like roles. Just like
\&\f(CW\*(C`base\*(C'\fR you can use either of the following invocations:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use mixin \*(AqMySpiffyBaseModule\*(Aq;
\&    use MySpiffyBaseModule \-mixin;
.Ve
.PP
The second version will only work if the class being mixed in is a
subclass of Spiffy.  The first version will work in all cases, as long
as Spiffy has already been loaded.
.PP
To limit the methods that get mixed in, use roles. (Hint: they work just like
an Exporter list):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use MySpiffyBaseModule \-mixin => qw(:basics x y !foo);
.Ve
.PP
In object oriented Perl almost every subroutine is a method. Each method
gets the object passed to it as its first argument. That means
practically every subroutine starts with the line:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     my $self = shift;
.Ve
.PP
Spiffy provides a simple, optional filter mechanism to insert that line
for you, resulting in cleaner code. If you figure an average method has
10 lines of code, that's 10% of your code! To turn this option on, you
just use the \f(CW\*(C`\-Base\*(C'\fR option instead of the \f(CW\*(C`\-base\*(C'\fR option, or add the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-selfless\*(C'\fR option. If source filtering makes you queazy, don't use the
feature. I personally find it addictive in my quest for writing squeaky
clean, maintainable code.
.PP
A useful feature of Spiffy is that it exports two functions: \f(CW\*(C`field\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR that can be used to declare the attributes of your class,
and automatically generate accessor methods for them. The only
difference between the two functions is that \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR attributes can not
be modified; thus the accessor is much faster.
.PP
One interesting aspect of \s-1OO\s0 programming is when a method calls the same
method from a parent class. This is generally known as calling a super
method. Perl's facility for doing this is butt ugly:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    sub cleanup {
\&        my $self = shift;
\&        $self\->scrub;
\&        $self\->SUPER::cleanup(@_);
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Spiffy makes it, er, super easy to call super methods. You just use
the \f(CW\*(C`super\*(C'\fR function. You don't need to pass it any arguments
because it automatically passes them on for you. Here's the same
function with Spiffy:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub cleanup {
\&        $self\->scrub;
\&        super;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Spiffy has a special method for parsing arguments called
\&\f(CW\*(C`parse_arguments\*(C'\fR, that it also uses for parsing its own arguments. You
declare which arguments are boolean (singletons) and which ones are
paired, with two special methods called \f(CW\*(C`boolean_arguments\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`paired_arguments\*(C'\fR. Parse arguments pulls out the booleans and pairs
and returns them in an anonymous hash, followed by a list of the
unmatched arguments.
.PP
Finally, Spiffy can export a few debugging functions \f(CW\*(C`WWW\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`XXX\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`YYY\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ZZZ\*(C'\fR. Each of them produces a \s-1YAML\s0 dump of its arguments.
\&\s-1WWW\s0 warns the output, \s-1XXX\s0 dies with the output, \s-1YYY\s0 prints the output,
and \s-1ZZZ\s0 confesses the output. If \s-1YAML\s0 doesn't suit your needs, you can
switch all the dumps to Data::Dumper format with the \f(CW\*(C`\-dumper\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
That's Spiffy!
.SH "Spiffy EXPORTING"
.IX Header "Spiffy EXPORTING"
Spiffy implements a completely new idea in Perl. Modules that act both
as object oriented classes and that also export functions. But it
takes the concept of Exporter.pm one step further; it walks the entire
\&\f(CW@ISA\fR path of a class and honors the export specifications of each
module. Since Spiffy calls on the Exporter module to do this, you can
use all the fancy interface features that Exporter has, including tags
and negation.
.PP
Spiffy considers all the arguments that don't begin with a dash to
comprise the export specification.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    package Vehicle;
\&    use Spiffy \-base;
\&    our $SERIAL_NUMBER = 0;
\&    our @EXPORT = qw($SERIAL_NUMBER);
\&    our @EXPORT_BASE = qw(tire horn);
\&
\&    package Bicycle;
\&    use Vehicle \-base, \*(Aq!field\*(Aq;
\&    $self\->inflate(tire);
.Ve
.PP
In this case, \f(CW\*(C`Bicycle\-\*(C'\fRisa('Vehicle')> and also all the things
that \f(CW\*(C`Vehicle\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Spiffy\*(C'\fR export, will go into \f(CW\*(C`Bicycle\*(C'\fR,
except \f(CW\*(C`field\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Exporting can be very helpful when you've designed a system with
hundreds of classes, and you want them all to have access to some
functions or constants or variables. Just export them in your main base
class and every subclass will get the functions they need.
.PP
You can do almost everything that Exporter does because Spiffy delegates
the job to Exporter (after adding some Spiffy magic). Spiffy offers a
\&\f(CW@EXPORT_BASE\fR variable which is like \f(CW@EXPORT\fR, but only for usages
that use \f(CW\*(C`\-base\*(C'\fR.
.SH "Spiffy MIXINs & ROLEs"
.IX Header "Spiffy MIXINs & ROLEs"
If you've done much \s-1OO\s0 programming in Perl you've probably used Multiple
Inheritance (\s-1MI\s0), and if you've done much \s-1MI\s0 you've probably run into
weird problems and headaches. Some languages like Ruby, attempt to
resolve \s-1MI\s0 issues using a technique called mixins. Basically, all Ruby
classes use only Single Inheritance (\s-1SI\s0), and then \fImixin\fR
functionality from other modules if they need to.
.PP
Mixins can be thought of at a simplistic level as \fIimporting\fR the
methods of another class into your subclass. But from an implementation
standpoint that's not the best way to do it. Spiffy does what Ruby
does. It creates an empty anonymous class, imports everything into that
class, and then chains the new class into your \s-1SI\s0 \s-1ISA\s0 path. In other
words, if you say:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    package A;
\&    use B \-base;
\&    use C \-mixin;
\&    use D \-mixin;
.Ve
.PP
You end up with a single inheritance chain of classes like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    A << A\-D << A\-C << B;
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\-D\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`A\-C\*(C'\fR are the actual package names of the generated
classes. The nice thing about this style is that mixing in C doesn't
clobber any methods in A, and D doesn't conflict with A or C either. If
you mixed in a method in C that was also in A, you can still get to it
by using \f(CW\*(C`super\*(C'\fR.
.PP
When Spiffy mixes in C, it pulls in all the methods in C that do not
begin with an underscore. Actually it goes farther than that. If C is a
subclass it will pull in every method that C \f(CW\*(C`can\*(C'\fR do through
inheritance. This is very powerful, maybe too powerful.
.PP
To limit what you mixin, Spiffy borrows the concept of Roles from
Perl6. The term role is used more loosely in Spiffy though. It's much
like an import list that the Exporter module uses, and you can use
groups (tags) and negation. If the first element of your list uses
negation, Spiffy will start with all the methods that your mixin
class can do.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use E \-mixin => qw(:tools walk !run !:sharp_tools);
.Ve
.PP
In this example, \f(CW\*(C`walk\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`run\*(C'\fR are methods that E can do, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`tools\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`sharp_tools\*(C'\fR are roles of class E. How does class E
define these roles? It very simply defines methods called \f(CW\*(C`_role_tools\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`_role_sharp_tools\*(C'\fR which return lists of more methods. (And
possibly other roles!) The neat thing here is that since roles are just
methods, they too can be inherited. Take \fBthat\fR Perl6!
.SH "Spiffy FILTERING"
.IX Header "Spiffy FILTERING"
By using the \f(CW\*(C`\-Base\*(C'\fR flag instead of \f(CW\*(C`\-base\*(C'\fR you never need to write the
line:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $self = shift;
.Ve
.PP
This statement is added to every subroutine in your class by using a source
filter. The magic is simple and fast, so there is litte performance penalty
for creating clean code on par with Ruby and Python.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package Example;
\&    use Spiffy \-Base;
\&
\&    sub crazy {
\&        $self\->nuts;
\&    }
\&    sub wacky { }
\&    sub new() {
\&        bless [], shift;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
is exactly the same as:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&    package Example;
\&    use Spiffy \-base;
\&    use strict;use warnings;
\&    sub crazy {my $self = shift;
\&        $self\->nuts;
\&    }
\&    sub wacky {my $self = shift; }
\&    sub new {
\&        bless [], shift;
\&    }
\&    ;1;
.Ve
.PP
Note that the empty parens after the subroutine \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR keep it from
having a \f(CW$self\fR added. Also note that the extra code is added to existing
lines to ensure that line numbers are not altered.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-Base\*(C'\fR also turns on the strict and warnings pragmas, and adds that
annoying '1;' line to your module.
.SH "PRIVATE METHODS"
.IX Header "PRIVATE METHODS"
Spiffy now has support for private methods when you use the '\-Base' filter
mechanism. You just declare the subs with the \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR keyword, and call them
with a \f(CW\*(Aq$\*(Aq\fR in front. Like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package Keen;
\&    use SomethingSpiffy \-Base;
\&
\&    # normal public method
\&    sub swell {
\&        $self\->$stinky;
\&    }
\&
\&    # private lexical method. uncallable from outside this file.
\&    my sub stinky {
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.SH "Spiffy DEBUGGING"
.IX Header "Spiffy DEBUGGING"
The \s-1XXX\s0 function is very handy for debugging because you can insert it
almost anywhere, and it will dump your data in nice clean \s-1YAML\s0. Take the
following statement:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @stuff = grep { /keen/ } $self\->find($a, $b);
.Ve
.PP
If you have a problem with this statement, you can debug it in any of the
following ways:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    XXX my @stuff = grep { /keen/ } $self\->find($a, $b);
\&    my @stuff = XXX grep { /keen/ } $self\->find($a, $b);
\&    my @stuff = grep { /keen/ } XXX $self\->find($a, $b);
\&    my @stuff = grep { /keen/ } $self\->find(XXX $a, $b);
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1XXX\s0 is easy to insert and remove. It is also a tradition to mark
uncertain areas of code with \s-1XXX\s0. This will make the debugging dumpers
easy to spot if you forget to take them out.
.PP
\&\s-1WWW\s0 and \s-1YYY\s0 are nice because they dump their arguments and then return the
arguments. This way you can insert them into many places and still have the
code run as before. Use \s-1ZZZ\s0 when you need to die with both a \s-1YAML\s0 dump and a
full stack trace.
.PP
The debugging functions are exported by default if you use the \f(CW\*(C`\-base\*(C'\fR
option, but only if you have previously used the \f(CW\*(C`\-XXX\*(C'\fR option. To
export all 4 functions use the export tag:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use SomeSpiffyModule \*(Aq:XXX\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
To force the debugging functions to use Data::Dumper instead of \s-1YAML:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use SomeSpiffyModule \-dumper;
.Ve
.SH "Spiffy FUNCTIONS"
.IX Header "Spiffy FUNCTIONS"
This section describes the functions the Spiffy exports. The \f(CW\*(C`field\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`stub\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`super\*(C'\fR functions are only exported when you use
the \f(CW\*(C`\-base\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-Base\*(C'\fR options.
.IP "\(bu" 4
field
.Sp
Defines accessor methods for a field of your class:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    package Example;
\&    use Spiffy \-Base;
\&    
\&    field \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq;
\&    field bar => [];
\&
\&    sub lalala {
\&        $self\->foo(42);
\&        push @{$self\->{bar}}, $self\->foo;
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
The first parameter passed to \f(CW\*(C`field\*(C'\fR is the name of the attribute
being defined. Accessors can be given an optional default value.
This value will be returned if no value for the field has been set
in the object.
.IP "\(bu" 4
const
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    const bar => 42;
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR function is similar to <field> except that it is immutable.
It also does not store data in the object. You probably always want to
give a \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR a default value, otherwise the generated method will be
somewhat useless.
.IP "\(bu" 4
stub
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    stub \*(Aqcigar\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`stub\*(C'\fR function generates a method that will die with an
appropriate message. The idea is that subclasses must implement these
methods so that the stub methods don't get called.
.IP "\(bu" 4
super
.Sp
If this function is called without any arguments, it will call the same
method that it is in, higher up in the \s-1ISA\s0 tree, passing it all the
same arguments. If it is called with arguments, it will use those
arguments with \f(CW$self\fR in the front. In other words, it just works
like you'd expect.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    sub foo {
\&        super;             # Same as $self\->SUPER::foo(@_);
\&        super(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq);    # Same as $self\->SUPER::foo(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq);
\&        $self\->bar(42);
\&    }
\&
\&    sub new() {
\&        my $self = super;
\&        $self\->init;
\&        return $self;
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`super\*(C'\fR will simply do nothing if there is no super method. Finally,
\&\f(CW\*(C`super\*(C'\fR does the right thing in \s-1AUTOLOAD\s0 subroutines.
.SH "Spiffy METHODS"
.IX Header "Spiffy METHODS"
This section lists all of the methods that any subclass of Spiffy
automatically inherits.
.IP "\(bu" 4
mixin
.Sp
A method to mixin a class at runtime. Takes the same arguments as \f(CW\*(C`use
mixin ...\*(C'\fR. Makes the target class a mixin of the caller.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $self\->mixin(\*(AqSomeClass\*(Aq);
\&    $object\->mixin(\*(AqSomeOtherClass\*(Aq => \*(Aqsome_method\*(Aq);
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
parse_arguments
.Sp
This method takes a list of arguments and groups them into pairs. It
allows for boolean arguments which may or may not have a value
(defaulting to 1). The method returns a hash reference of all the pairs
as keys and values in the hash. Any arguments that cannot be paired, are
returned as a list. Here is an example:

.SH "Spiffy ARGUMENTS"
.IX Header "Spiffy ARGUMENTS"
When you \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR the Spiffy module or a subclass of it, you can pass it a
list of arguments. These arguments are parsed using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`parse_arguments\*(C'\fR method described above. The special argument 
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-base\*(C'\fR, is used to make the current package a subclass of the Spiffy
module being used.
.PP
Any non-paired parameters act like a normal import list; just like those
used with the Exporter module.
.SH "USING Spiffy WITH base.pm"
.IX Header "USING Spiffy WITH base.pm"
The proper way to use a Spiffy module as a base class is with the \f(CW\*(C`\-base\*(C'\fR
parameter to the \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR statement. This differs from typical modules where you
would want to \f(CW\*(C`use base\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    package Something;
\&    use Spiffy::Module \-base;
\&    use base \*(AqNonSpiffy::Module\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
Now it may be hard to keep track of what's Spiffy and what is not.
Therefore Spiffy has actually been made to work with base.pm. You can
say:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    package Something;
\&    use base \*(AqSpiffy::Module\*(Aq;
\&    use base \*(AqNonSpiffy::Module\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`use base\*(C'\fR is also very useful when your class is not an actual module (a
separate file) but just a package in some file that has already been loaded.
\&\f(CW\*(C`base\*(C'\fR will work whether the class is a module or not, while the \f(CW\*(C`\-base\*(C'\fR
syntax cannot work that way, since \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR always tries to load a module.
.SS "base.pm Caveats"
.IX Subsection "base.pm Caveats"
To make Spiffy work with base.pm, a dirty trick was played. Spiffy swaps
\&\f(CW\*(C`base::import\*(C'\fR with its own version. If the base modules are not Spiffy,
Spiffy calls the original base::import. If the base modules are Spiffy,
then Spiffy does its own thing.
.PP
There are two caveats.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Spiffy must be loaded first.
.Sp
If Spiffy is not loaded and \f(CW\*(C`use base\*(C'\fR is invoked on a Spiffy module,
Spiffy will die with a useful message telling the author to read this
documentation. That's because Spiffy needed to do the import swap
beforehand.
.Sp
If you get this error, simply put a statement like this up front in
your code:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use Spiffy ();
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
No Mixing
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`base.pm\*(C'\fR can take multiple arguments. And this works with Spiffy as
long as all the base classes are Spiffy, or they are all non-Spiffy. If
they are mixed, Spiffy will die. In this case just use separate \f(CW\*(C`use
base\*(C'\fR statements.
.SH "Spiffy TODO LIST"
.IX Header "Spiffy TODO LIST"
Spiffy is a wonderful way to do \s-1OO\s0 programming in Perl, but it is still
a work in progress. New things will be added, and things that don't work
well, might be removed.
