.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Given a list of scalars or reference variables, writes out
their contents in perl syntax. The references can also be
objects. The contents of each variable is output using the least
number of Perl statements as convenient, usually only one.
Self-referential structures, closures, and objects are output
correctly.
.PP
The return value can be evaled to get back an identical copy
of the original reference structure. In some cases this may
require the use of utility subs that
Data::Dump::Streamer will optionally
export.
.PP
This module is very similar in concept to the core module
Data::Dumper, with the major differences
being that this module is designed to output to a stream
instead of constructing its output in memory (trading speed
for memory), and that the traversal over the data structure
is effectively breadth first versus the depth first
traversal done by the others.
.PP
In fact the data structure is scanned twice, first in
breadth first mode to perform structural analysis, and then
in depth first mode to actually produce the output, but
obeying the depth relationships of the first pass.
.SS "Caveats Dumping Closures (\s-1CODE\s0 Refs)"
.IX Subsection "Caveats Dumping Closures (CODE Refs)"
As of version 1.11 \s-1DDS\s0 has had the ability to dump closures properly. This
means that the lexicals that are bound to the closure are dumped along
with the subroutine that uses them. This makes it much easier to debug
code that uses closures and to a certain extent provides a persistancy
framework for closure based code. The way this works is that \s-1DDS\s0 figures
out what all the lexicals are that are bound to \s-1CODE\s0 refs it is dumping
and then pretends that it had originally been called with all of them as
its arguements, (along with the original arguments as well of course.)
.PP
One consequence of the way the dumping process works is that all of the
recreated subroutines will be in the same scope. This of course can lead
to collisions as two subroutines can easily be bound to different
variables that have the same name.
.PP
The way that \s-1DDS\s0 resolves these collisions is that it renames one of the
variables with a special name so that presumably there are no collisions.
However this process is very simplistic with no checks to prevent
collisions with other lexicals or other globals that may be used by other
dumped code.  In some situations it may be necessary to change the default
value of the rename template which may be done by using the \f(CW\*(C`EclipseName\*(C'\fR
method.
.PP
Similarly to the problem of colliding lexicals is the problem of colliding
lexicals and globals. \s-1DDS\s0 pays no attention to globals when dumping
closures which can potentially result in lexicals being declared that will
eclipse their global namesake. There is currently no way around this other
than to avoid accessing a global and a lexical with the same name from the
subs being dumped. An example is
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $a = sub { $a++ };
\&  Dump( sub { $a\->() } );
.Ve
.PP
which will not be dumped correctly. Generally speaking this kind of thing
is bad practice anyway, so this should probably be viewed as a \*(L"feature\*(R".
:\-)
.PP
Generally if the closures being dumped avoid accessing lexicals and
globals with the same name from out of scope and that all of the \s-1CODE\s0
being dumped avoids vars with the \f(CW\*(C`EclipseName\*(C'\fR in their names the dumps
should be valid and should eval back into existance properly.
.PP
Note that the behaviour of dumping closures is subject to change in future
versions as its possible that I will put some additional effort into more
sophisiticated ways of avoiding name collisions in the dump.
.SH "USAGE"
.IX Header "USAGE"
While Data::Dump::Streamer is at heart an object oriented module, it is
expected (based on experience with using Data::Dumper)
that the common case will not exploit these features. Nevertheless the
method based approach is convenient and accordingly a compromise hybrid
approach has been provided via the \f(CW\*(C`Dump()\*(C'\fR subroutine. Such as
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   Dump($foo);
\&   $as_string= Dump($foo)\->Out();
.Ve
.PP
All attribute methods are designed to be chained together.  This means
that when used as set attribute (called with arguments) they return the
object they were called against. When used as get attributes (called
without arguments) they return the value of the attribute.
.PP
From an \s-1OO\s0 point of view the key methods are the \f(CW\*(C`Data()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Out()\*(C'\fR
methods. These correspond to the breadth first and depth first traversal,
and need to be called in this order. Some attributes \fImust\fR be set prior
to the \f(CW\*(C`Data()\*(C'\fR phase and some need only be set before the \f(CW\*(C`Out()\*(C'\fR
phase.
.PP
Attributes once set last the lifetime of the object, unless explicitly
reset.
.SS "Controlling Object Representation"
.IX Subsection "Controlling Object Representation"
This module provides hooks to allow objects to override how they are
represented. The basic idea is that a subroutine (or method) is provided
which is responsible for the override. The return of the method governs
how the object will be represented when dumped, and how it will be
restored. The basic calling convention is
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my ( $proxy, $thaw, $postop )= $callback\->($obj);
\&    #or                          = $obj\->$method();
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Freezer()\*(C'\fR method controls what methods to use as a default method
and also allows per class overrides. When dumping an object of a given
class the first time it tries to execute the class specific handler if
it is specified, then the user specific generic handler if its been
specified and then \*(L"DDS_freeze\*(R". This means that class authors can
implement a \f(CW\*(C`DDS_freeze()\*(C'\fR method and their objects will automatically
be serialized as necessary. \fBNote\fR that if either the class specific or
generic handler is defined but false \f(CW\*(C`DDS_freeze()\*(C'\fR will not be used
even if it is present.
.PP
The interface of the \f(CW\*(C`Freezer()\*(C'\fR handler in detail is as follows:
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB$obj\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CB$obj\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$obj"
The object being dumped.
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB$proxy\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CB$proxy\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$proxy"
This is what will be dumped instead of \f(CW$obj\fR. It may be one of
the following values:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP "\fI\fI""undef""\fI\fR (first time only)" 8
.el .IP "\fI\f(CIundef\fI\fR (first time only)" 8
.IX Item "undef (first time only)"
On the first time a serialization hook is called in a dump it may return
undef or the empty list to indicate that it shouldn't be used again for
this class during this pass. Any other time undef is treated the same
as false.
.IP "\fI\s-1FALSE\s0 value\fR" 8
.IX Item "FALSE value"
A false value for \f(CW$proxy\fR is taken to mean that it should be ignored.
Its like saying IgnoreClass(ref($obj)); \fBNote\fR that undef has a special
meaning when the callback is called the first time.
.IP "\fIA Reference\fR" 8
.IX Item "A Reference"
A reference that will be dumped instead of the object.
.IP "\fIPerl Code\fR" 8
.IX Item "Perl Code"
A string that is to be treated as code and inserted directly into the
dump stream as a proxy for the original. Note that the code must be
able to execute inline or in other words must evaluate to a perl \s-1EXPR\s0.
Use \f(CW\*(C`do{}\*(C'\fR to wrap multistatement code.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB$thaw\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CB$thaw\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thaw"
This values is used to allow extra control over how the object will be
recreated when dumped. It is used for converting the \f(CW$proxy\fR representation
into the real thing. It is only relevent when \f(CW$proxy\fR is a reference.
.RS 4
.IP "\fI\s-1FALSE\s0 value\fR" 8
.IX Item "FALSE value"
Indicates no thaw action is to be included for this object.
.IP "\fISub or Method Name\fR" 8
.IX Item "Sub or Method Name"
A string matching \f(CW\*(C`/^(\->)?((?:\ew*::)\ew+)(\e(\e))?$/\*(C'\fR in which case it
is taken as a sub name when the string ends in () and a method name
when the string doesnt. If the \f(CW\*(C`\->\*(C'\fR is present then the sub or method
is called inline. If it is not then the sub or method is called
after the main dump.
.IP "\fIPerl Code\fR" 8
.IX Item "Perl Code"
Any other string, in which case the result will be taken as code
which will be emitted after the main dump. It will be wrapped
in a for loop that aliases \f(CW$_\fR to the variable in question.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB$postdump\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CB$postdump\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$postdump"
This is the similar to \f(CW$thaw\fR but is called in process instead
of being emitted as part of the dump. Any return is ignored.
It is only relevent when \f(CW$proxy\fR is a reference.
.RS 4
.IP "\fI\s-1FALSE\s0 value\fR" 8
.IX Item "FALSE value"
No postdump action is to occur.
.IP "\fICode Reference\fR" 8
.IX Item "Code Reference"
The code ref will be called after serialization is complete
with the object as the argument.
.IP "\fIMethod Name\fR" 8
.IX Item "Method Name"

An example DDS_freeze method is one I had to put together for an object
which contained a key whose value was a ref to an array tied to the value
of another key. Dumping this got crazy, so I wanted to surpress dumping
the tied array. I did it this way:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    sub DDS_freeze {
\&        my $self=shift;
\&        delete $self\->{\*(Aqtie\*(Aq};
\&        return ($self,\*(Aq\->fix_tie\*(Aq,\*(Aqfix_tie\*(Aq);
\&    }
\&
\&    sub fix_tie {
\&        my $self=shift;
\&        if ( ! $self\->{\*(Aqtie\*(Aq} ) {
\&            $self\->{str}="" unless defined $self\->{str};
\&            tie my @a, \*(AqTie::Array::PackedC\*(Aq, $self\->{str};
\&            $self\->{\*(Aqtie\*(Aq} = \e@a;
\&        }
\&        return $self;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW$postop\fR means the object is relatively unaffected after the
dump, the \f(CW$thaw\fR says that we should also include the method
inline as we dump. An example dump of an object like this might be
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $Foo1=bless({ str=>\*(Aq\*(Aq },\*(AqFoo\*(Aq)\->fix_tie();
.Ve
.PP
Wheras if we omit the \f(CW\*(C`\->\*(C'\fR then we would get:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $Foo1=bless({ str=>\*(Aq\*(Aq },\*(AqFoo\*(Aq);
\&    $Foo1\->fix_tie();
.Ve
.PP
In our example it wouldn't actually make a difference, but the former
style can be nicer to read if the object is embedded in another.
However the non arrow notation is slightly more dangerous, in that
its possible that the internals of the object will not be fully linked
when the method is evaluated. The second form guarantees that the object
will be fully linked when the method is evaluated.
.PP
See \*(L"Controlling Hash Traversal and Display Order\*(R" for a different way
to control the representation of hash based objects.
.SS "Controlling Hash Traversal and Display Order"
.IX Subsection "Controlling Hash Traversal and Display Order"
When dumping a hash you may control the order the keys will be output
and which keys will be included. The basic idea is to specify a subroutine
which takes a hash as an argument and returns a reference to an array
containing the keys to be dumped.
.PP
You can use the \fIKeyOrder()\fR routine or the \fISortKeys()\fR routine to
specify the sorter to be used.
.PP
The routine will be called in the following way:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   ( $key_array, $thaw ) = $sorter\->($hash,($pass=0),$addr,$class);
\&   ( $key_array,)        = $sorter\->($hash,($pass=1),$addr,$class);
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW$hash\fR is the hash to be dumped, \f(CW$addr\fR is the \fIrefaddr()\fR of the
\&\f(CW$hash\fR, and \f(CW$class\fR will be set if the hash has been blessed.
.PP
When \f(CW$pass\fR is 0 the \f(CW$thaw\fR variable may be supplied as well as the
keyorder. If it is defined then it specifies what thaw action to perform
after dumping the hash. See \f(CW$thaw\fR in \*(L"Controlling Object
Representation\*(R" for details as to how it works.  This allows an object
to define those keys needed to recreate itself properly, and a followup
hook to recreate the rest.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR that if a \fIFreezer()\fR method is defined and returns
a \f(CW$thaw\fR then the \f(CW$thaw\fR returned by the sorter
will override it.
.SS "Controlling Array Presentation and Run Length Encoding"
.IX Subsection "Controlling Array Presentation and Run Length Encoding"
By default Data::Dump::Streamer will \*(L"run length encode\*(R" array values.
This means that when an array value is simple (ie, its not referenced and
does contain a reference) and is repeated mutliple times the output will
be single a list multiplier statement, and not each item output
seperately. Thus: \f(CW\*(C`Dump([0,0,0,0])\*(C'\fR will be output somthing like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $ARRAY1 = [ (0) x 4 ];
.Ve
.PP
This is particularly useful when dealing with large arrays that are only
partly filled, and when accidentally the array has been made very large,
such as with the improper use of pseudo-hash notation.
.PP
To disable this feature you may set the \fIRle()\fR property to \s-1FALSE\s0, by
default it is enabled and set to \s-1TRUE\s0.
.SS "Installing \fI\s-1DDS\s0\fP as a package alias"
.IX Subsection "Installing DDS as a package alias"
Its possible to have an alias to Data::Dump::Streamer created and
installed for easier useage in one liners and short scripts.
Data::Dump::Streamer is a bit long to type sometimes. However because this
technically means polluting the root level namespace, and having it listed
on \s-1CPAN\s0, I have elected to have the installer not install it by default.
If you wish it to be installed you must explicitly state so when
Build.Pl is run:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perl Build.Pl DDS [Other Module::Build options]
.Ve
.PP
Then a normal './Build test, ./Build install' invocation will install \s-1DDS\s0.
.PP
Using \s-1DDS\s0 is identical to Data::Dump::Streamer.
.SS "use-time package aliasing"
.IX Subsection "use-time package aliasing"
You can also specify an alias at use-time, then use that alias in the rest
of your program, thus avoiding the permanent (but modest) namespace
pollution of the previous method.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Data::Dumper::Streamer as => \*(AqDDS\*(Aq;
\&
\&  # or if you prefer
\&  use Data::Dumper::Streamer;
\&  import Data::Dumper::Streamer as => \*(AqDDS\*(Aq;

.SS "PadWalker support"
.IX Subsection "PadWalker support"
If PadWalker 1.0 is installed you can use \fIDumpLex()\fR to try to

instead of the B:: modules when dumping closures when it is available.

which means it returns an object reference.
.Sp
If called with arguments and in scalar context it is equivelent to calling
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Data::Dump::Streamer\->new()\->Data(@vals)
.Ve
.Sp
except that the actual depth first traversal is \fIdelayed\fR until \f(CW\*(C`Out()\*(C'\fR
is called.  This means that options that must be provided before the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Data()\*(C'\fR phase can be provided after the call to \f(CW\*(C`Dump()\*(C'\fR.  Again, it
returns a object reference.
.Sp
If called with arguments and in void or list context it is equivelent to
calling
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Data::Dump::Streamer\->new()\->Data(@vals)\->Out()
.Ve
.Sp
The reason this is true in list context is to make
\&\f(CW\*(C`print Dump(...),"\en";\*(C'\fR do the right thing. And also that combined with
method chaining options can be added or removed as required quite easily
and naturally.
.Sp
So to put it short:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  my $obj=Dump($x,$y);         # Returns an object
\&  my $str=Dump($x,$y)\->Out();  # Returns a string of the dump.
\&  my @code=Dump($x,$y);        # Returns a list of the dump.
\&
\&  Dump($x,$y);                 # prints the dump.
\&  print Dump($x,$y);           # prints the dump.
.Ve
.Sp
It should be noted that the setting of \f(CW\*(C`$\e\*(C'\fR will affect the behaviour of
both of
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  Dump($x,$y);
\&  print Dump($x,$y);
.Ve
.Sp
but it will not affect the behaviour of
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  print scalar Dump($x,$y);
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fBNote\fR As of 1.11 Dump also works as a method, with identical properties
as when called as a subroutine, with the exception that when called with
no arguments it is a synonym for \f(CW\*(C`Out()\*(C'\fR. Thus
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $obj\->Dump($foo)\->Names(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq)\->Out();
.Ve
.Sp
will work fine, as will the odd looking:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $obj\->Dump($foo)\->Names(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq)\->Dump();
.Ve
.Sp
which are both the same as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $obj\->Names(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq)\->Data($foo)\->Out();
.Ve
.Sp
Hopefully this should make method use more or less \s-1DWIM\s0.
.IP "DumpLex \s-1VALUES\s0" 4
.IX Item "DumpLex VALUES"
DumpLex is similar to Dump except it will try to automatically determine
the names to use for the variables being dumped by using PadWalker to
have a poke around the calling lexical scope to see what is declared. If
a name for a var can't be found then it will be named according to the
normal scheme. When PadWalker isn't installed this is just a wrapper for
\&\fIDump()\fR.
.Sp
Thanks to Ovid for the idea of this. See Data::Dumper::Simple for a
similar wrapper around Data::Dumper.

This is wrapper around \fIDump()\fR which expect to receive

passed to \fINames()\fR.

If no names are provided then names are generated automatically based on
the type of object being dumped, with abreviations applied to compound

.IP "Purity \s-1BOOL\s0" 4

.PD
This option can be used to set the level of purity in the output. It
defaults to \s-1TRUE\s0, which results in the module doing its best to ensure
that the resulting dump when \fIeval()\fRed is precisely the same as the input.
However, at times such as debugging this can be tedius, resulting in
extremely long dumps with many \*(L"fix\*(R" statements involved.  By setting
Purity to \s-1FALSE\s0 the resulting output won't necessarily be legal Perl, but
it will be more legible. In this mode the output is boardly similar to
that of the default setting of Data::Dumper (\fIPurity\fR\|(0)). When set to \s-1TRUE\s0
the behaviour is likewise similar to Data::Dumper in \fIPurity\fR\|(1) but more
accurate.
.Sp
When \fIPurity()\fR is set to \s-1FALSE\s0 aliases will be output with a function call
wrapper of 'alias_to' whose argument will be the value the item is an
alias to. This wrapper does nothing, and is only there as a visual cue.
Likewise, 'make_ro' will be output when the value was readonly, and again
the effect is cosmetic only.

If Verbose is True then when references that cannot be resolved in a

reference, and \*(L"A:\*(R" for alias, \*(L"V:\*(R" for a value and then the name of the
var in a string. Automatically generated var names are also reduced to
the shortest possible unique abbreviation, with some tricks thrown in
for Long::Class::Names::Like::This (which would abbreviate most likely
to \s-1LCNLT1\s0)
.Sp
If Verbose if False then a simple placeholder saying 'A' or 'R' is
provided. (In most situations perl requires a placeholder, and as such
one is always provided, even if technically it could be omitted.)

Controls compression of string values (not keys). If this value
is nonzero and a string to be dumped is longer than its value then

This attribute is used to control the compression of strings.
It is expected to be a reference to a subroutine with the following
interface:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  my $prelude_code=$compressor\->(); # no arguments.
\&  my $code=$compressor\->(\*(Aqstring\*(Aq); # string argument
.Ve
.Sp
The sub will be called with no arguments at the beginning of the
dump to allow any require statments or similar to be added. During
the dump the sub will be called with a single argument when
compression is required. The code returned in this case is expected
to be an \s-1EXPR\s0 that will evaluate back to the original string.
.Sp
By default \s-1DDS\s0 will use Compress::Zlib in conjunction with
MIME::Base64 to do compression and encoding, and exposes the
\&'usqz' subroutine for handling the decoding and decompression.
.Sp
The abbreviated name was chosen as when using the default compressor
every string will be represented by a string like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   usqz(\*(Aq....\*(Aq)
.Ve
.Sp
Meaning that eight characters are required without considering the
data itself. Likewise Base64 was chosen because it is a representation
that is high-bit safe, compact and easy to quote. Escaped strings are
much less efficient for storing binary data.
.SS "Reading the Output"
.IX Subsection "Reading the Output"
As mentioned in Verbose there is a notation used to make understanding
the output easier. However at first glance it can probably be a bit
confusing. Take the following example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    my $x=1;
\&    my $y=[];
\&    my $array=sub{\e@_ }\->( $x,$x,$y );
\&    push @$array,$y,1;
\&    unshift @$array,\e$array\->[\-1];
\&    Dump($array);
.Ve
.PP
Which prints (without the comments of course):
.PP
.Vb 11
\&    $ARRAY1 = [
\&                \*(AqR: $ARRAY1\->[5]\*(Aq,        # resolved by fix 1
\&                1,
\&                \*(AqA: $ARRAY1\->[1]\*(Aq,        # resolved by fix 2
\&                [],
\&                \*(AqV: $ARRAY1\->[3]\*(Aq,        # resolved by fix 3
\&                1
\&              ];
\&    $ARRAY1\->[0] = \e$ARRAY1\->[5];         # fix 1
\&    alias_av(@$ARRAY1, 2, $ARRAY1\->[1]);  # fix 2
\&    $ARRAY1\->[4] = $ARRAY1\->[3];          # fix 3
.Ve
.PP
The first entry, \f(CW\*(AqR: $ARRAY1\->[5]\*(Aq\fR indicates that this slot in the
array holds a reference to the currently undefined \f(CW\*(C`$ARRAY1\->[5]\*(C'\fR,
and as such the value will have to be provided later in what the author
calls 'fix' statements. The third entry \f(CW\*(AqA: $ARRAY1\->[1]\*(Aq\fR indicates
that is element of the array is in fact the exact same scalar as exists in
\&\f(CW\*(C`$ARRAY1\->[1]\*(C'\fR, or is in other words, an alias to that variable.
Again, this cannot be expressed in a single statment and so generates
another, different, fix statement. The fifth entry \f(CW\*(AqV: $ARRAY1\->[3]\*(Aq\fR
indicates that this slots holds a value (actually a reference value)
that is identical to one elsewhere, but is currently undefined.  In this
case it is because the value it needs is the reference returned by the
anonymous array constructer in the fourth element (\f(CW\*(C`$ARRAY1\->[3]\*(C'\fR).
Again this results in yet another different fix statement.  If \fIVerbose()\fR
is off then only a 'R' 'A' or 'V' tag is emitted as a marker of some form
is necessary.
.PP
All of this specialized behaviour can be bypassed by setting \fIPurity()\fR to
\&\s-1FALSE\s0, in which case the output will look very similar to what
Data::Dumper outputs in low Purity setting.

By default exports only \fIDump()\fR, \fIDumpLex()\fR and \fIDumpVars()\fR. Tags are
provided for exporting 'all' subroutines, as well as 'bin' (not \fIDump()\fR),
\&'util' (only introspection utilities) and 'alias' for the aliasing
utilities. If you need to ensure that you can eval the results (undump)
then use the 'undump' tag.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
Code with this many debug statements is certain to have errors. :\-)
.PP
Please report them with as much of the error output as possible.
.PP
Be aware that to a certain extent this module is subject to whimsies of
your local perl. The same code may not produce the same dump on two
different installs and versions. Luckily these dont seem to pop up often.
