.SH "NAME"
Catalyst::Delta \- Overview of changes between versions of Catalyst
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is an overview of the user-visible changes to Catalyst between major Catalyst releases.
.SS "\s-1VERSION\s0 5.9XXXX 'cataplack'"
.IX Subsection "VERSION 5.9XXXX 'cataplack'"
The Catalyst::Engine sub-classes have all been removed and deprecated,
to be replaced with Plack handlers.
.PP
Plack is an implementation of the \s-1PSGI\s0 specification, which is
a standard interface between web servers and application frameworks.
.PP
This should be no different for developers, and you should not have to
migrate your applications unless you are using a custom engine already.
.PP
This change benefits Catalyst significantly by reducing the amount of
code inside the framework, and means that the framework gets upstream
bug fixes in Plack, and automatically gains support for any web server
which a \s-1PSGI\s0 compliant handler is written for.
.PP
It also allows you more flexibility with your application, and allows
the use of cross web framework 'middleware'.
.PP
Developers are recommended to read Catalyst::Upgrading for notes about
upgrading, especially if you are using an unusual deployment method.
.PP
Documentation for how to take advantage of \s-1PSGI\s0 can be found in
Catalyst::PSGI, and information about deploying your application
has been moved to Catalyst::Manual::Deployment.
.PP
\fIUpdated modules:\fR
.IX Subsection "Updated modules:"
.PP
A number of modules have been updated to pass their tests or not
produce deprecation warnings with the latest version of Catalyst.
It is recommended that you upgrade any of these that you are using
after installing this version of Catalyst.
.PP
These extensions are:
.IP "Catalyst::Engine::HTTP::Prefork" 4
.IX Item "Catalyst::Engine::HTTP::Prefork"
This is now deprecated, see Catalyst::Upgrading.
.IP "Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst" 4
.IX Item "Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst"
Has been updated to not produce deprecation warnings, upgrade recommended.
.IP "Catalyst::ActionRole::ACL" 4
.IX Item "Catalyst::ActionRole::ACL"
Has been updated to fix failing tests (although older versions still
function perfectly with this version of Catalyst).
.IP "Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::DBIC" 4
.IX Item "Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::DBIC"
Has been updated to fix failing tests (although older versions still
function perfectly with this version of Catalyst).
.IP "Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication" 4
.IX Item "Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication"
Has been updated to fix failing tests (although older versions still
function perfectly with this version of Catalyst).
.SH "PREVIOUS VERSIONS"
.IX Header "PREVIOUS VERSIONS"
.SS "\s-1VERSION\s0 5.8XXXX 'catamoose'"
.IX Subsection "VERSION 5.8XXXX 'catamoose'"
\fIDeprecations\fR
.IX Subsection "Deprecations"
.PP
Please see Catalyst::Upgrading for a full description of how changes in the
framework may affect your application.
.PP
Below is a brief list of features which have been deprecated in this release:
.IP "::[\s-1MVC\s0]:: style naming scheme has been deprecated and will warn" 4
.IX Item "::[MVC]:: style naming scheme has been deprecated and will warn"
.PD 0
.IP "\s-1NEXT\s0 is deprecated for all applications and components, use MRO::Compat" 4
.IX Item "NEXT is deprecated for all applications and components, use MRO::Compat"
.IP "Dispatcher methods which are an implementation detail made private, public versions now warn." 4
.IX Item "Dispatcher methods which are an implementation detail made private, public versions now warn."
.IP "MyApp\->plugin method is deprecated, use Catalyst::Model::Adaptor instead." 4
.IX Item "MyApp->plugin method is deprecated, use Catalyst::Model::Adaptor instead."
.IP "_\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->\fImk_accessors()\fR is supported for backward compatibility only, use Moose attributes instead in new code." 4
.IX Item "__PACKAGE__->mk_accessors() is supported for backward compatibility only, use Moose attributes instead in new code."

.IX Item "Add the dispatch_type method"
.PD
.PP
\fIRestarter\fR
.IX Subsection "Restarter"
.PP
The development server restarter has been improved to be compatible with
immutable Moose classes, and also to optionally use 
B::Hooks::OP::Check::StashChange to handle more complex application layouts
correctly.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$c\fI\->uri_for_action method.\fR
.IX Subsection "$c->uri_for_action method."
.PP
Give a private path to the Catalyst action you want to create a \s-1URI\s0 for.
.PP
\fILogging\fR
.IX Subsection "Logging"
.PP
Log levels have been made additive.
.PP
\fICatalyst::Test\fR

.PD
.PP
\fICatalyst::Response\fR
.IX Subsection "Catalyst::Response"
.IP "\(bu" 4
New print method which prints \f(CW@data\fR to the output stream, separated by $,.  
This lets you pass the response object to functions that want to write to an 
IO::Handle.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Added code method as an alias for \f(CW\*(C`$res\->status\*(C'\fR
.PP
\fIConsequences of the Moose back end\fR
.IX Subsection "Consequences of the Moose back end"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Components are fully compatible with Moose, and all Moose features, such as
method modifiers, attributes, roles, \s-1BUILD\s0 and \s-1BUILDARGS\s0 methods are fully
supported and may be used in components and applications.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Many reusable extensions which would previously have been plugins or base 
classes are better implemented as Moose roles.
.IP "\(bu" 4
MooseX::MethodAttributes::Inheritable is used to contain action
attributes. This means that attributes are represented in the \s-1MOP\s0, and
decouples action creation from attributes.
.IP "\(bu" 4
There is a reasonable \s-1API\s0 in Catalyst::Controller for working with
and registering actions, allowing a controller sub-class to replace
subroutine attributes for action declarations with an alternate
syntax.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Refactored capturing of \f(CW$app\fR from Catalyst::Controller into
Catalyst::Component::ApplicationAttribute for easier reuse in other
components.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Your application class is forced to become immutable at the end of compilation.
.PP
\fIBug fixes\fR
.IX Subsection "Bug fixes"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Don't ignore \s-1SIGCHLD\s0 while handling requests with the development server, so that
\&\fIsystem()\fR and other ways of creating child processes work as expected.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fixes for FastCGI when used with \s-1IIS\s0 6.0
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fix a bug in uri_for which could cause it to generate paths with multiple 
slashes in them.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fix a bug in Catalyst::Stats, stopping garbage being inserted into
the stats if a user calls begin => but no end
