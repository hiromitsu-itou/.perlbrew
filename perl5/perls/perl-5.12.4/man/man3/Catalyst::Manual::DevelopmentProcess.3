.Ve
.PP
Everyone is welcome (and will be encouraged) to contribute to Catalyst
in whatever capacity they're able to. People in #catalyst\-dev will be
more than happy to talk newcomers through contributing their first patch,
or how best to go about their first \s-1CPAN\s0 extension module....

.IX Subsection "Discussing proposed bugfixes or improvements"
<http://wiki.catalystframework.org/wiki/#Community> has information about how
to get in touch with the Catalyst \*(L"community\*(R".  In particular, you would
want to discuss a proposed change on the mailing list:

.SH "The Catalyst Core Team"
.IX Header "The Catalyst Core Team"
The intention of the Catalyst Core Team is to maintain and support the
Catalyst framework, in order for it to be a viable and stable framework
for developing web-based \s-1MVC\s0 applications. This includes both technical
decisions about the Catalyst core distribution, and public relations
relating to the Catalyst framework as a whole.
.PP
The current goals of the Catalyst core development team are stability,
performance, and a properly paced addition of features, with a focus on
extensibility.
.PP
The core team is concerned with the 'core' Catalyst distributions
(i.e. Catalyst::Runtime, Catalyst::Devel and Catalyst::Manual),
and also tries to encourage best practices for extension authors, and
cooperation and shared vision within the Catalyst community.
.SS "Membership"
.IX Subsection "Membership"
The Catalyst Core Team consists of the developers who have full commit
privileges to the entire Catalyst source tree, and who have made a significant
contribution to the core Catalyst distributions, and various extensions and
plugins.
.PP
In addition, the core team includes members that have non-technical
roles, such as marketing, legal, or economic responsibilities.
.PP
Currently, the Core Team consists of the following people:
.IP "Brian Cassidy" 4
.IX Item "Brian Cassidy"
.PD 0
.IP "Andy Grundman" 4
.IX Item "Andy Grundman"
.IP "Christian Hansen" 4

.IP "Florian Ragwitz" 4

.IP "Tomas Doran" 4
.IX Item "Tomas Doran"
.PD
.PP
New members of the Core Team must be accepted by a 2/3 majority by the
current members.
.SS "Technical Decisions."
.IX Subsection "Technical Decisions."
Any change to the Catalyst core which can not be conceived as a
correction of an error in the current feature set will need to be
accepted by at least 3 members of the Core Team before it can be
committed to master (which is the basis for \s-1CPAN\s0 releases). Anyone
with access is at any time free to make a branch to develop a proof of
concept for a feature to be committed to master.
.SS "Organizational and Philosophical Decisions."
.IX Subsection "Organizational and Philosophical Decisions."
Any organizational or philosophical decision should be decided by
majority vote. Thus it should be a goal of the organization that its
membership number should at any time be an odd number, to render it
effective with regards to decision making. The exceptions to this rule
are changes to this charter and additions to the membership of the Core
Team, which require a 2/3 majority.
.SS "\s-1CPAN\s0 Releases"
.IX Subsection "CPAN Releases"
Planned releases to \s-1CPAN\s0 should be performed by the release manager, at
the time of writing Marcus Ramberg, or the deputy release manager, at
the time of writing Florian Ragwitz. In the case of critical error
correction, any member of the Core Team can perform a rescue release.
.SS "Public statements from the Core Team"
.IX Subsection "Public statements from the Core Team"
The Core Team should strive to appear publicly as a group when answering
questions or other correspondence. In cases where this is not possible,
the same order as for \s-1CPAN\s0 releases applies.
.SS "New Catalyst Extensions"
.IX Subsection "New Catalyst Extensions"
As Catalyst is deliberately designed for extension, there is an ecosystem of
several hundred Catalyst extensions that can be found on \s-1CPAN\s0.
.PP
See Catalyst::Manual::ExtendingCatalyst for more information on how
to extend Catalyst in various ways and how to write CPANable components
for Catalyst which can be reused in many applications.
.PP
It is recommended to post a request for comments to the Catalyst mailing
list, or ask around in the #catalyst \s-1IRC\s0 channel before starting to
implement something, as another member of the community is likely to
have example or prototype code that you can reuse, and members of the
community and core team are happy to advise on the best way to implement
a generic solution to a particular problem.
.PP
This could save you duplicate work, and will help you produce a better
thought out and designed extension.
