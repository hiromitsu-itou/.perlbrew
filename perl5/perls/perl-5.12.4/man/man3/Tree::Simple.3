.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module in an fully object-oriented implementation of a simple n\-ary 
tree. It is built upon the concept of parent-child relationships, so 
therefore every \fBTree::Simple\fR object has both a parent and a set of 
children (who themselves may have children, and so on). Every \fBTree::Simple\fR 
object also has siblings, as they are just the children of their immediate 
parent.
.PP
It is can be used to model hierarchal information such as a file-system, 
the organizational structure of a company, an object inheritance hierarchy, 
versioned files from a version control system or even an abstract syntax 
tree for use in a parser. It makes no assumptions as to your intended usage, 
but instead simply provides the structure and means of accessing and 
traversing said structure.
.PP
This module uses exceptions and a minimal Design By Contract style. All method 
arguments are required unless specified in the documentation, if a required 
argument is not defined an exception will usually be thrown. Many arguments 
are also required to be of a specific type, for instance the \f(CW$parent\fR 
argument to the constructor \fBmust\fR be a \fBTree::Simple\fR object or an object 
derived from \fBTree::Simple\fR, otherwise an exception is thrown. This may seems 
harsh to some, but this allows me to have the confidence that my code works as 
I intend, and for you to enjoy the same level of confidence when using this 
module. Note however that this module does not use any Exception or Error module, 
the exceptions are just strings thrown with \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR.
.PP
I consider this module to be production stable, it is based on a module which has 
been in use on a few production systems for approx. 2 years now with no issue. 
The only difference is that the code has been cleaned up a bit, comments added and 
the thorough tests written for its public release. I am confident it behaves as 
I would expect it to, and is (as far as I know) bug-free. I have not stress-tested 
it under extreme duress, but I don't so much intend for it to be used in that 
type of situation. If this module cannot keep up with your Tree needs, i suggest 
switching to one of the modules listed in the \*(L"\s-1OTHER\s0 \s-1TREE\s0 \s-1MODULES\s0\*(R" section below.
.SH "CONSTANTS"
.IX Header "CONSTANTS"
.IP "\fB\s-1ROOT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "ROOT"
This class constant serves as a placeholder for the root of our tree. If a tree 
does not have a parent, then it is considered a root.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS "Constructor"
.IX Subsection "Constructor"
.ie n .IP "\fBnew ($node, \fB$parent\fB)\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBnew ($node, \f(CB$parent\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "new ($node, $parent)"
The constructor accepts two arguments a \f(CW$node\fR value and an optional \f(CW$parent\fR. 
The \f(CW$node\fR value can be any scalar value (which includes references and objects). 
The optional \f(CW$parent\fR value must be a \fBTree::Simple\fR object, or an object 
derived from \fBTree::Simple\fR. Setting this value implies that your new tree is a 
child of the parent tree, and therefore adds it to the parent's children. If the 
\&\f(CW$parent\fR is not specified then its value defaults to \s-1ROOT\s0.
.SS "Mutator Methods"
.IX Subsection "Mutator Methods"
.IP "\fBsetNodeValue ($node_value)\fR" 4
.IX Item "setNodeValue ($node_value)"
This sets the node value to the scalar \f(CW$node_value\fR, an exception is thrown if 
\&\f(CW$node_value\fR is not defined.
.IP "\fBsetUID ($uid)\fR" 4
.IX Item "setUID ($uid)"
This allows you to set your own unique \s-1ID\s0 for this specific Tree::Simple object. 
A default value derived from the object's hex address is provided for you, so use 
of this method is entirely optional. It is the responsibility of the user to 
ensure the value's uniqueness, all that is tested by this method is that \f(CW$uid\fR 
is a true value (evaluates to true in a boolean context). For even more information 
about the Tree::Simple \s-1UID\s0 see the \f(CW\*(C`getUID\*(C'\fR method.
.IP "\fBaddChild ($tree)\fR" 4
.IX Item "addChild ($tree)"
This method accepts only \fBTree::Simple\fR objects or objects derived from 
\&\fBTree::Simple\fR, an exception is thrown otherwise. This method will append 
the given \f(CW$tree\fR to the end of it's children list, and set up the correct 
parent-child relationships. This method is set up to return its invocant so 
that method call chaining can be possible. Such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  my $tree = Tree::Simple\->new("root")\->addChild(Tree::Simple\->new("child one"));
.Ve
.Sp
Or the more complex:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  my $tree = Tree::Simple\->new("root")\->addChild(
\&                         Tree::Simple\->new("1.0")\->addChild(
\&                                     Tree::Simple\->new("1.0.1")     
\&                                     )
\&                         );
.Ve
.IP "\fBaddChildren (@trees)\fR" 4
.IX Item "addChildren (@trees)"
This method accepts an array of \fBTree::Simple\fR objects, and adds them to 
it's children list. Like \f(CW\*(C`addChild\*(C'\fR this method will return its invocant 
to allow for method call chaining.
.ie n .IP "\fBinsertChild ($index, \fB$tree\fB)\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBinsertChild ($index, \f(CB$tree\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "insertChild ($index, $tree)"
This method accepts a numeric \f(CW$index\fR and a \fBTree::Simple\fR object (\f(CW$tree\fR), 
and inserts the \f(CW$tree\fR into the children list at the specified \f(CW$index\fR. 
This results in the shifting down of all children after the \f(CW$index\fR. The 
\&\f(CW$index\fR is checked to be sure it is the bounds of the child list, if it 
out of bounds an exception is thrown. The \f(CW$tree\fR argument's type is 
verified to be a \fBTree::Simple\fR or \fBTree::Simple\fR derived object, if 
this condition fails, an exception is thrown.
.ie n .IP "\fBinsertChildren ($index, \fB@trees\fB)\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBinsertChildren ($index, \f(CB@trees\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "insertChildren ($index, @trees)"
This method functions much as insertChild does, but instead of inserting a 
single \fBTree::Simple\fR, it inserts an array of \fBTree::Simple\fR objects. It 
too bounds checks the value of \f(CW$index\fR and type checks the objects in 
\&\f(CW@trees\fR just as \f(CW\*(C`insertChild\*(C'\fR does.
.ie n .IP "\fBremoveChild\fR ($child | $index)>" 4
.el .IP "\fBremoveChild\fR ($child | \f(CW$index\fR)>" 4
.IX Item "removeChild ($child | $index)>"
Accepts two different arguemnts. If given a \fBTree::Simple\fR object (\f(CW$child\fR), 
this method finds that specific \f(CW$child\fR by comparing it with all the other 
children until it finds a match. At which point the \f(CW$child\fR is removed. If 
no match is found, and exception is thrown. If a non\-\fBTree::Simple\fR object 
is given as the \f(CW$child\fR argument, an exception is thrown.
.Sp
This method also accepts a numeric \f(CW$index\fR and removes the child found at 
that index from it's list of children. The \f(CW$index\fR is bounds checked, if 
this condition fail, an exception is thrown.
.Sp
When a child is removed, it results in the shifting up of all children after 
it, and the removed child is returned. The removed child is properly 
disconnected from the tree and all its references to its old parent are 
removed. However, in order to properly clean up and circular references 
the removed child might have, it is advised to call it's \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR method. 
See the \*(L"\s-1CIRCULAR\s0 \s-1REFERENCES\s0\*(R" section for more information.
.IP "\fBaddSibling ($tree)\fR" 4
.IX Item "addSibling ($tree)"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBaddSiblings (@trees)\fR" 4
.IX Item "addSiblings (@trees)"
.ie n .IP "\fBinsertSibling ($index, \fB$tree\fB)\fR" 4

.IX Item "insertSibling ($index, $tree)"
.ie n .IP "\fBinsertSiblings ($index, \fB@trees\fB)\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBinsertSiblings ($index, \f(CB@trees\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "insertSiblings ($index, @trees)"
.PD
The \f(CW\*(C`addSibling\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`addSiblings\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`insertSibling\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`insertSiblings\*(C'\fR 
methods pass along their arguments to the \f(CW\*(C`addChild\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`addChildren\*(C'\fR, 
\&\f(CW\*(C`insertChild\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`insertChildren\*(C'\fR methods of their parent object 
respectively. This eliminates the need to overload these methods in subclasses 
which may have specialized versions of the *Child(ren) methods. The one 
exceptions is that if an attempt it made to add or insert siblings to the 
\&\fB\s-1ROOT\s0\fR of the tree then an exception is thrown.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR
There is no \f(CW\*(C`removeSibling\*(C'\fR method as I felt it was probably a bad idea. 
The same effect can be achieved by manual upwards traversal.
.SS "Accessor Methods"
.IX Subsection "Accessor Methods"
.IP "\fBgetNodeValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "getNodeValue"
This returns the value stored in the object's node field.
.IP "\fBgetUID\fR" 4
.IX Item "getUID"
This returns the unique \s-1ID\s0 associated with this particular tree. This can 
be custom set using the \f(CW\*(C`setUID\*(C'\fR method, or you can just use the default. 
The default is the hex-address extracted from the stringified Tree::Simple 
object. This may not be a \fIuniversally\fR unique identifier, but it should 
be adequate for at least the current instance of your perl interpreter. If 
you need a \s-1UUID\s0, one can be generated with an outside module (there are 
    many to choose from on \s-1CPAN\s0) and the \f(CW\*(C`setUID\*(C'\fR method (see above).
.IP "\fBgetChild ($index)\fR" 4
.IX Item "getChild ($index)"
This returns the child (a \fBTree::Simple\fR object) found at the specified 
\&\f(CW$index\fR. Note that we do use standard zero-based array indexing.
.IP "\fBgetAllChildren\fR" 4
.IX Item "getAllChildren"
This returns an array of all the children (all \fBTree::Simple\fR objects). 
It will return an array reference in scalar context.
.IP "\fBgetSibling ($index)\fR" 4
.IX Item "getSibling ($index)"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBgetAllSiblings\fR" 4
.IX Item "getAllSiblings"
.PD
Much like \f(CW\*(C`addSibling\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`addSiblings\*(C'\fR, these two methods simply call 
\&\f(CW\*(C`getChild\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`getAllChildren\*(C'\fR on the invocant's parent.
.IP "\fBgetDepth\fR" 4
.IX Item "getDepth"
Returns a number representing the invocant's depth within the hierarchy of 
\&\fBTree::Simple\fR objects.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR A \f(CW\*(C`ROOT\*(C'\fR tree has the depth of \-1. This be because Tree::Simple 
assumes that a tree's root will usually not contain data, but just be an 
anchor for the data-containing branches. This may not be intuitive in all 
cases, so I mention it here.
.IP "\fBgetParent\fR" 4
.IX Item "getParent"
Returns the invocant's parent, which could be either \fB\s-1ROOT\s0\fR or a 
\&\fBTree::Simple\fR object.
.IP "\fBgetHeight\fR" 4
.IX Item "getHeight"
Returns a number representing the length of the longest path from the current 
tree to the furthest leaf node.
.IP "\fBgetWidth\fR" 4
.IX Item "getWidth"
Returns the a number representing the breadth of the current tree, basically 
it is a count of all the leaf nodes.
.IP "\fBgetChildCount\fR" 4
.IX Item "getChildCount"
Returns the number of children the invocant contains.
.IP "\fBgetIndex\fR" 4
.IX Item "getIndex"
Returns the index of this tree within its parent's child list. Returns \-1 if 
the tree is the root.
.SS "Predicate Methods"
.IX Subsection "Predicate Methods"
.IP "\fBisLeaf\fR" 4
.IX Item "isLeaf"
Returns true (1) if the invocant does not have any children, false (0) otherwise.
.IP "\fBisRoot\fR" 4
.IX Item "isRoot"
Returns true (1) if the invocant's \*(L"parent\*(R" field is \fB\s-1ROOT\s0\fR, returns false 
(0) otherwise.
.SS "Recursive Methods"
.IX Subsection "Recursive Methods"
.IP "\fBtraverse ($func, ?$postfunc)\fR" 4
.IX Item "traverse ($func, ?$postfunc)"
This method accepts two arguments a mandatory \f(CW$func\fR and an optional
\&\f(CW$postfunc\fR. If the argument \f(CW$func\fR is not defined then an exception
is thrown. If \f(CW$func\fR or \f(CW$postfunc\fR are not in fact \s-1CODE\s0 references
then an exception is thrown. The function \f(CW$func\fR is then applied
recursively to all the children of the invocant. If given, the function
\&\f(CW$postfunc\fR will be applied to each child after the child's children
have been traversed.
.Sp
Here is an example of a traversal function that will print out the
hierarchy as a tabbed in list.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  $tree\->traverse(sub {
\&      my ($_tree) = @_;
\&      print (("\et" x $_tree\->getDepth()), $_tree\->getNodeValue(), "\en");
\&  });
.Ve
.Sp

\&  },
\&  sub {

\&      print ((\*(Aq \*(Aq x $_tree\->getDepth()),
\&              \*(Aq</\*(Aq, $_tree\->getNodeValue(),\*(Aq>\*(Aq,"\en");
\&  });
.Ve

Returns the total number of nodes in the current tree and all its sub-trees.
.IP "\fBheight\fR" 4

This method has also been \fBdeprecated\fR in favor of the \f(CW\*(C`getHeight\*(C'\fR method above, 
it remains as an alias to \f(CW\*(C`getHeight\*(C'\fR for backwards compatability.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR This is also no longer a recursive method which get's it's value on demand, 
but a value stored in the Tree::Simple object itself, hopefully making it much 
more efficient and usable.
.SS "Visitor Methods"
.IX Subsection "Visitor Methods"
.IP "\fBaccept ($visitor)\fR" 4
.IX Item "accept ($visitor)"
It accepts either a \fBTree::Simple::Visitor\fR object (which includes classes derived 
    from \fBTree::Simple::Visitor\fR), or an object who has the \f(CW\*(C`visit\*(C'\fR method available 
    (tested with \f(CW\*(C`$visitor\->can(\*(Aqvisit\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR). If these qualifications are not met, 
    and exception will be thrown. We then run the Visitor's \f(CW\*(C`visit\*(C'\fR method giving the 
    current tree as its argument.
.Sp
I have also created a number of Visitor objects and packaged them into the 
\&\fBTree::Simple::VisitorFactory\fR.
.SS "Cloning Methods"
.IX Subsection "Cloning Methods"
Cloning a tree can be an extremly expensive operation for large trees, so we provide 
two options for cloning, a deep clone and a shallow clone.
.PP
When a Tree::Simple object is cloned, the node is deep-copied in the following manner. 
If we find a normal scalar value (non-reference), we simply copy it. If we find an 
object, we attempt to call \f(CW\*(C`clone\*(C'\fR on it, otherwise we just copy the reference (since 
we assume the object does not want to be cloned). If we find a \s-1SCALAR\s0, \s-1REF\s0 reference we 
copy the value contained within it. If we find a \s-1HASH\s0 or \s-1ARRAY\s0 reference we copy the 
reference and recursively copy all the elements within it (following these exact 
guidelines). We also do our best to assure that circular references are cloned 
only once and connections restored correctly. This cloning will not be able to copy 
\&\s-1CODE\s0, RegExp and \s-1GLOB\s0 references, as they are pretty much impossible to clone. We 
also do not handle \f(CW\*(C`tied\*(C'\fR objects, and they will simply be copied as plain 
references, and not re\-\f(CW\*(C`tied\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBclone\fR" 4
.IX Item "clone"
The clone method does a full deep-copy clone of the object, calling \f(CW\*(C`clone\*(C'\fR recursively 
on all its children. This does not call \f(CW\*(C`clone\*(C'\fR on the parent tree however. Doing 
this would result in a slowly degenerating spiral of recursive death, so it is not 
recommended and therefore not implemented. What happens is that the tree instance 
that \f(CW\*(C`clone\*(C'\fR is actually called upon is detached from the tree, and becomes a root 
node, all if the cloned children are then attached as children of that tree. I personally 
think this is more intuitive then to have the cloning crawl back \fIup\fR the tree is not 
what I think most people would expect.
.IP "\fBcloneShallow\fR" 4
.IX Item "cloneShallow"
This method is an alternate option to the plain \f(CW\*(C`clone\*(C'\fR method. This method allows the 
cloning of single \fBTree::Simple\fR object while retaining connections to the rest of the 
tree/hierarchy.
.SS "Misc. Methods"
.IX Subsection "Misc. Methods"
.IP "\fB\s-1DESTROY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DESTROY"
To avoid memory leaks through uncleaned-up circular references, we implement the 
\&\f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR method. This method will attempt to call \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR on each of its 
children (if it has any). This will result in a cascade of calls to \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR on 
down the tree. It also cleans up it's parental relations as well.
.Sp
Because of perl's reference counting scheme and how that interacts with circular 
references, if you want an object to be properly reaped you should manually call 
\&\f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR. This is especially nessecary if your object has any children. See the 
section on \*(L"\s-1CIRCULAR\s0 \s-1REFERENCES\s0\*(R" for more information.
.IP "\fBfixDepth\fR" 4
.IX Item "fixDepth"
Tree::Simple will manage your tree's depth field for you using this method. You 
should never need to call it on your own, however if you ever did need to, here 
is it. Running this method will traverse your all the invocant's sub-trees 
correcting the depth as it goes.
.IP "\fBfixHeight\fR" 4
.IX Item "fixHeight"
Tree::Simple will manage your tree's height field for you using this method. 
You should never need to call it on your own, however if you ever did need to, 
here is it. Running this method will correct the heights of the current tree 
and all it's ancestors.
.IP "\fBfixWidth\fR" 4
.IX Item "fixWidth"
Tree::Simple will manage your tree's width field for you using this method. You 
should never need to call it on your own, however if you ever did need to, 
here is it. Running this method will correct the widths of the current tree 
and all it's ancestors.
.SS "Private Methods"
.IX Subsection "Private Methods"
I would not normally document private methods, but in case you need to subclass 
Tree::Simple, here they are.
.ie n .IP "\fB_init ($node, \fB$parent\fB, \f(BI$children\fB)\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB_init ($node, \f(CB$parent\fB, \f(CB$children\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "_init ($node, $parent, $children)"
This method is here largely to facilitate subclassing. This method is called by 
new to initialize the object, where new's primary responsibility is creating 
the instance.
.IP "\fB_setParent ($parent)\fR" 4
.IX Item "_setParent ($parent)"
This method sets up the parental relationship. It is for internal use only.
.IP "\fB_setHeight ($child)\fR" 4
.IX Item "_setHeight ($child)"
This method will set the height field based upon the height of the given \f(CW$child\fR.
.SH "CIRCULAR REFERENCES"
.IX Header "CIRCULAR REFERENCES"
I have revised the model by which Tree::Simple deals with ciruclar references. 
In the past all circular references had to be manually destroyed by calling 
\&\s-1DESTROY\s0. The call to \s-1DESTROY\s0 would then call \s-1DESTROY\s0 on all the children, and 
therefore cascade down the tree. This however was not always what was needed, 
nor what made sense, so I have now revised the model to handle things in what 
I feel is a more consistent and sane way.
.PP
Circular references are now managed with the simple idea that the parent makes 
the descisions for the child. This means that child-to-parent references are 
weak, while parent-to-child references are strong. So if a parent is destroyed 
it will force all it's children to detach from it, however, if a child is 
destroyed it will not be detached from it's parent.
.SS "Optional Weak References"
.IX Subsection "Optional Weak References"
By default, you are still required to call \s-1DESTROY\s0 in order for things to 
happen. However I have now added the option to use weak references, which 
alleviates the need for the manual call to \s-1DESTROY\s0 and allows Tree::Simple 
to manage this automatically. This is accomplished with a compile time 
setting like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Tree::Simple \*(Aquse_weak_refs\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
And from that point on Tree::Simple will use weak references to allow for 
perl's reference counting to clean things up properly.
.PP
For those who are unfamilar with weak references, and how they affect the 
reference counts, here is a simple illustration. First is the normal model 
that Tree::Simple uses:
.PP
.Vb 10
\& +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
\& | Tree::Simple1 |<\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
\& +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+                      |
\& | parent        |                      |
\& | children      |\-+                    |
\& +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+ |                    |
\&                   |                    |
\&                   |  +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+ |
\&                   +\->| Tree::Simple2 | |
\&                      +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+ |
\&                      | parent        |\-+
\&                      | children      |
\&                      +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
.Ve
.PP
Here, Tree::Simple1 has a reference count of 2 (one for the original 
variable it is assigned to, and one for the parent reference in 
Tree::Simple2), and Tree::Simple2 has a reference count of 1 (for the 
child reference in Tree::Simple2).
.PP
Now, with weak references:
.PP
.Vb 10
\& +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
\& | Tree::Simple1 |.......................
\& +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+                      :
\& | parent        |                      :
\& | children      |\-+                    : <\-\-[ weak reference ]
\& +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+ |                    :
\&                   |                    :
\&                   |  +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+ :
\&                   +\->| Tree::Simple2 | :
\&                      +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+ :
\&                      | parent        |..
\&                      | children      |
\&                      +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
.Ve
.PP
Now Tree::Simple1 has a reference count of 1 (for the variable it is 
assigned to) and 1 weakened reference (for the parent reference in 
Tree::Simple2). And Tree::Simple2 has a reference count of 1, just 
as before.

.SH "OTHER TREE MODULES"
.IX Header "OTHER TREE MODULES"
There are a few other Tree modules out there, here is a quick comparison 
between \fBTree::Simple\fR and them. Obviously I am biased, so take what I say 
with a grain of salt, and keep in mind, I wrote \fBTree::Simple\fR because I 
could not find a Tree module that suited my needs. If \fBTree::Simple\fR does 
not fit your needs, I recommend looking at these modules. Please note that 
I am only listing Tree::* modules I am familiar with here, if you think I 
have missed a module, please let me know. I have also seen a few tree-ish 
modules outside of the Tree::* namespace, but most of them are part of 
another distribution (\fBHTML::Tree\fR, \fBPod::Tree\fR, etc) and are likely 
specialized in purpose.
.IP "Tree::DAG_Node" 4
.IX Item "Tree::DAG_Node"
This module seems pretty stable and very robust with a lot of functionality. 
However, \fBTree::DAG_Node\fR does not come with any automated tests. It's 
\&\fItest.pl\fR file simply checks the module loads and nothing else. While I 
am sure the author tested his code, I would feel better if I was able to 
see that. The module is approx. 3000 lines with \s-1POD\s0, and 1,500 without the 
\&\s-1POD\s0. The shear depth and detail of the documentation and the ratio of code 
to documentation is impressive, and not to be taken lightly. But given that 
it is a well known fact that the likeliness of bugs increases along side the 
size of the code, I do not feel comfortable with large modules like this 
which have no tests.
.Sp
All this said, I am not a huge fan of the \s-1API\s0 either, I prefer the gender 
neutral approach in \fBTree::Simple\fR to the mother/daughter style of \fBTree::DAG_Node\fR. 
I also feel very strongly that \fBTree::DAG_Node\fR is trying to do much more 
than makes sense in a single module, and is offering too many ways to do 
the same or similar things.
.Sp
However, of all the Tree::* modules out there, \fBTree::DAG_Node\fR seems to 
be one of the favorites, so it may be worth investigating.
.IP "Tree::MultiNode" 4
.IX Item "Tree::MultiNode"
I am not very familiar with this module, however, I have heard some good 
reviews of it, so I thought it deserved mention here. I believe it is 
based upon \*(C+ code found in the book \fIAlgorithms in \*(C+\fR by Robert Sedgwick. 
It uses a number of interesting ideas, such as a ::Handle object to traverse 
the tree with (similar to Visitors, but also seem to be to be kind of like 
a cursor). However, like \fBTree::DAG_Node\fR, it is somewhat lacking in tests 
and has only 6 tests in its suite. It also has one glaring bug, which is 
that there is currently no way to remove a child node.
.IP "Tree::Nary" 4
.IX Item "Tree::Nary"
It is a (somewhat) direct translation of the N\-ary tree from the \s-1GLIB\s0 
library, and the \s-1API\s0 is based on that. \s-1GLIB\s0 is a C library, which means 
this is a very C\-ish \s-1API\s0. That doesn't appeal to me, it might to you, to 
each their own.
.Sp
This module is similar in intent to \fBTree::Simple\fR. It implements a tree 
with \fIn\fR branches and has polymorphic node containers. It implements much 
of the same methods as \fBTree::Simple\fR and a few others on top of that, but 
being based on a C library, is not very \s-1OO\s0. In most of the method calls 
the \f(CW$self\fR argument is not used and the second argument \f(CW$node\fR is. 
\&\fBTree::Simple\fR is a much more \s-1OO\s0 module than \fBTree::Nary\fR, so while they 
are similar in functionality they greatly differ in implementation style.
.IP "Tree" 4
.IX Item "Tree"
This module is pretty old, it has not been updated since Oct. 31, 1999 and 
is still on version 0.01. It also seems to be (from the limited documentation) 
a binary and a balanced binary tree, \fBTree::Simple\fR is an \fIn\fR\-ary tree, and 
makes no attempt to balance anything.
.IP "Tree::Ternary" 4
.IX Item "Tree::Ternary"
This module is older than \fBTree\fR, last update was Sept. 24th, 1999. It 
seems to be a special purpose tree, for storing and accessing strings, 
not general purpose like \fBTree::Simple\fR.
.IP "Tree::Ternary_XS" 4
.IX Item "Tree::Ternary_XS"
This module is an \s-1XS\s0 implementation of the above tree type.
.IP "Tree::Trie" 4
.IX Item "Tree::Trie"
This too is a specialized tree type, it sounds similar to the \fBTree::Ternary\fR, 
but it much newer (latest release in 2003). It seems specialized for the lookup 
and retrieval of information like a hash.
.IP "Tree::M" 4
.IX Item "Tree::M"
Is a wrapper for a \*(C+ library, whereas \fBTree::Simple\fR is pure-perl. It also 
seems to be a more specialized implementation of a tree, therefore not really 
the same as \fBTree::Simple\fR.
.IP "Tree::Fat" 4
.IX Item "Tree::Fat"
Is a wrapper around a C library, again \fBTree::Simple\fR is pure-perl. The author 
describes FAT-trees as a combination of a Tree and an array. It looks like a 
pretty mean and lean module, and good if you need speed and are implementing a 
custom data-store of some kind. The author points out too that the module is 
designed for embedding and there is not default embedding, so you can't really 
use it \*(L"out of the box\*(R".
