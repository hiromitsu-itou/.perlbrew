=head1 NAME

Test::MooseX::Daemonize - Tool to help test MooseX::Daemonize applications

=head1 VERSION

This document describes MooseX::Daemonize version 0.0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::Spec::Functions;
    use File::Temp qw(tempdir);

    my $dir = tempdir( CLEANUP => 1 );

    ## Try to make sure we are in the test directory

    my $file = catfile( $dir, "im_alive" );
    my $daemon = FileMaker->new( pidbase => $dir, filename => $file );

    daemonize_ok( $daemon, 'child forked okay' );
    ok( -e $file, "$file exists" );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides some basic Test::Builder compatible test methods to
use when writing tests for you MooseX::Daemonize based modules.

=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item B<daemonize_ok ( $daemon, ?$msg )>

This will attempt to daemonize your C<$daemon> returning ok on
success and not ok on failure.

=item B<check_test_output ( $daemon )>

This is expected to be used with a C<$daemon> which does the
B<Test::MooseX::Daemonize::Testable> role (included in this package
see the source for more info). It will collect the test output
from your daemon and apply it in the parent process by mucking
around with L<Test::Builder> stuff, again, read the source for
more info. If we get time we will document this more thoroughly.
