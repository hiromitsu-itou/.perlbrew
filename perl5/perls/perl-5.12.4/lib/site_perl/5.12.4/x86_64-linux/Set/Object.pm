Set::Object - set of objects and strings

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Set::Object;

  my $set = set();            # or Set::Object->new()

  $set->insert(@thingies);
  $set->remove(@thingies);

  @items = @$set;             # or $set->members;

  $union = $set1 + $set2;
  $intersection = $set1 * $set2;
  $difference = $set1 - $set2;
  $symmetric_difference = $set1 % $set2;

  print "set1 is a proper subset of set2"
      if $set1 < $set2;

  print "set1 is a subset of set2"
      if $set1 <= $set2;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This modules implements a set of objects, that is, an unordered
collection of objects without duplication.

The term I<objects> is applied loosely - for the sake of
L<Set::Object>, anything that is a reference is considered an object.

L<Set::Object> 1.09 and later includes support for inserting scalars
(including the empty string, but excluding C<undef>) as well as
objects.  This can be thought of as (and is currently implemented as)
a degenerate hash that only has keys and no values.  Unlike objects
placed into a Set::Object, scalars that are inserted will be flattened
into strings, so will lose any magic (eg, tie) or other special bits
that they went in with; only strings come out.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 Set::Object->new( [I<list>] )

Return a new C<Set::Object> containing the elements passed in I<list>.

=head2 C<set(@members)>

Return a new C<Set::Object> filled with C<@members>.  You have to
explicitly import this method.

B<New in Set::Object 1.22>: this function is now called as a method
to return new sets the various methods that return a new set, such as
C<-E<gt>intersection>, C<-E<gt>union>, etc and their overloaded
counterparts.  The default method always returns C<Set::Object>
objects, preserving previous behaviour and not second guessing the
nature of your derived L<Set::Object> class.

=head2 C<weak_set()>

Return a new C<Set::Object::Weak>, filled with C<@members>.  You have
to explicitly import this method.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 insert( [I<list>] )

Add items to the C<Set::Object>.

Adding the same object several times is not an error, but any
C<Set::Object> will contain at most one occurence of the same object.

Returns the number of elements that were actually added.  As of
Set::Object 1.23, C<undef> will not insert.

=head2 includes( [I<list>] )

=head2 has( [I<list>] )

=head2 contains( [I<list>] )

Return C<true> if B<all> the objects in I<list> are members of the
C<Set::Object>.  I<list> may be empty, in which case C<true> is
always returned.

As of Set::Object 1.23, C<undef> will never appear to be present in
any set (even if the set contains the empty string).  Prior to 1.23,
there would have been a run-time warning.

=head2 member( [I<item>] )

=head2 element( [I<item>] )

Like C<includes>, but takes a single item to check and returns that
item if the value is found, rather than just a true value.

=head2 members

=head2 elements

Return the objects contained in the C<Set::Object> in random (hash)
order.

=head2 size

Return the number of elements in the C<Set::Object>.

=head2 remove( [I<list>] )

=head2 delete( [I<list>] )

Remove objects from a C<Set::Object>.

Removing the same object more than once, or removing an object absent
from the C<Set::Object> is not an error.

Returns the number of elements that were actually removed.

As of Set::Object 1.23, removing C<undef> is safe (but having an
C<undef> in the passed in list does not increase the return value,
because it could never be in the set)

=head2 weaken

Makes all the references in the set "weak" - that is, they do not
increase the reference count of the object they point to, just like
L<Scalar::Util|Scalar::Util>'s C<weaken> function.

This was introduced with Set::Object 1.16, and uses a brand new type
of magic.  B<Use with caution>.  If you get segfaults when you use
C<weaken>, please reduce your problem to a test script before
submission.

B<New:> as of Set::Object 1.19, you may use the C<weak_set> function
to make weak sets, or C<Set::Object::Weak-E<gt>new>, or import the
C<set> constructor from C<Set::Object::Weak> instead.  See
L<Set::Object::Weak> for more.

B<Note to people sub-classing C<Set::Object>:> this method re-blesses
the invocant to C<Set::Object::Weak>.  Override the method C<weak_pkg>
in your sub-class to control this behaviour.

=head2 is_weak

Returns a true value if this set is a weak set.

=head2 strengthen

Turns a weak set back into a normal one.

B<Note to people sub-classing C<Set::Object>:> this method re-blesses
the invocant to C<Set::Object>.  Override the method C<strong_pkg> in
your sub-class to control this behaviour.

=head2 invert( [I<list>] )

For each item in I<list>, it either removes it or adds it to the set,
so that a change is always made.

Also available as the overloaded operator C</>, in which case it
expects another set (or a single scalar element), and returns a new
set that is the original set with all the second set's items inverted.

=head2 clear

Empty this C<Set::Object>.

=head2 as_string

Return a textual Smalltalk-ish representation of the C<Set::Object>.
Also available as overloaded operator "".

=head2 equal( I<set> )

Returns a true value if I<set> contains exactly the same members as
the invocant.

Also available as overloaded operator C<==> (or C<eq>).

=head2 not_equal( I<set> )

Returns a false value if I<set> contains exactly the same members as
the invocant.

Also available as overloaded operator C<!=> (or C<ne>).

=head2 intersection( [I<list>] )

Return a new C<Set::Object> containing the intersection of the
C<Set::Object>s passed as arguments.

Also available as overloaded operator C<*>.

=head2 union( [I<list>] )

Return a new C<Set::Object> containing the union of the
C<Set::Object>s passed as arguments.

Also available as overloaded operator C<+>.

=head2 difference ( I<set> )

Return a new C<Set::Object> containing the members of the first
(invocant) set with the passed C<Set::Object>s' elements removed.

Also available as overloaded operator C<->.

=head2 unique ( I<set> )

=head2 symmetric_difference ( I<set> )

Return a new C<Set::Object> containing the members of all passed sets
(including the invocant), with common elements removed.  This will be
the opposite (complement) of the I<intersection> of the two sets.

Also available as overloaded operator C<%>.

=head2 subset( I<set> )

Return C<true> if this C<Set::Object> is a subset of I<set>.

Also available as operator C<E<lt>=>.

=head2 proper_subset( I<set> )

Return C<true> if this C<Set::Object> is a proper subset of I<set>
Also available as operator C<E<lt>>.

=head2 superset( I<set> )

Return C<true> if this C<Set::Object> is a superset of I<set>.
Also available as operator C<E<gt>=>.

=head2 proper_superset( I<set> )

Return C<true> if this C<Set::Object> is a proper superset of I<set>
Also available as operator C<E<gt>>.

=head2 is_null( I<set> )

Returns a true value if this set does not contain any members, that
is, if its size is zero.

=head1 Set::Scalar compatibility methods

By and large, L<Set::Object> is not and probably never will be
feature-compatible with L<Set::Scalar>; however the following
functions are provided anyway.

=head2 compare( I<set> )

returns one of:

  "proper intersect"
  "proper subset"
  "proper superset"
  "equal"
  "disjoint"

=head2 is_disjoint( I<set> )

Returns a true value if the two sets have no common items.

=head2 as_string_callback( I<set> )

Allows you to define a custom stringify function.  This is only a
class method.  If you want anything fancier than this, you should
sub-class Set::Object.


=head1 FUNCTIONS

The following functions are defined by the Set::Object XS code for
convenience; they are largely identical to the versions in the
Scalar::Util module, but there are a couple that provide functions not
catered to by that module.

Please use the versions in L<Scalar::Util> in preference to these
functions.

=over

=item B<blessed>

Returns a true value if the passed reference (RV) is blessed.  See
also L<Acme::Holy>.

=item B<reftype>

A bit like the perl built-in C<ref> function, but returns the I<type>
of reference; ie, if the reference is blessed then it returns what
C<ref> would have if it were not blessed.  Useful for "seeing through"
blessed references.

=item B<refaddr>

Returns the memory address of a scalar.  B<Warning>: this is I<not>
guaranteed to be unique for scalars created in a program; memory might
get re-used!

=item B<is_int>, B<is_string>, B<is_double>

A quick way of checking the three bits on scalars - IOK (is_int), NOK
(is_double) and POK (is_string).  Note that the exact behaviour of
when these bits get set is not defined by the perl API.

This function returns the "p" versions of the macro (SvIOKp, etc); use
with caution.

=item B<is_overloaded>

A quick way to check if an object has overload magic on it.

=item B<ish_int>

This function returns true, if the value it is passed looks like it
I<already is> a representation of an I<integer>.  This is so that you
can decide whether the value passed is a hash key or an array
index.

=item B<is_key>

This function returns true, if the value it is passed looks more like
an I<index> to a collection than a I<value> of a collection.

But wait, you say - Set::Object has no indices, one of the fundamental
properties of a Set is that it is an I<unordered collection>.  Which
means I<no indices>.  Well, if this module were ever to be derived to
be a more general multi-purpose collection, then this (and C<ish_int>)
might be a good function to use to distinguish different types of
indexes from values.

=item B<get_magic>

Pass to a scalar, and get the magick wand (C<mg_obj>) used by the weak
set implementation.  The return will be a list of integers which are
pointers to the actual C<ISET> structure.  Whatever you do don't
change the array :).  This is used only by the test suite, and if you
find it useful for something then you should probably conjure up a
test suite and send it to me, otherwise it could get pulled.

=back

=head1 CLASS METHODS

These class methods are probably only interesting to those
sub-classing C<Set::Object>.

=over

=item strong_pkg

When a set that was already weak is strengthened using
C<-E<gt>strengthen>, it gets re-blessed into this package.

=item weak_pkg

When a set that was NOT already weak is weakened using
C<-E<gt>weaken>, it gets re-blessed into this package.

=item tie_array_pkg

When the object is accessed as an array, tie the array into this
package.

=item tie_hash_pkg

When the object is accessed as a hash, tie the hash into this package.

=back

=head1 SERIALIZATION

It is possible to serialize C<Set::Object> objects via L<Storable> and
duplicate via C<dclone>; such support was added in release 1.04.  As
of C<Set::Object> version 1.15, it is possible to freeze scalar items,
too.

However, the support for freezing scalar items introduced a backwards
incompatibility.  Earlier versions than 1.15 will C<thaw> sets frozen
using Set::Object 1.15 and later as a set with one item - an array
that contains the actual members.

Additionally, version 1.15 had a bug that meant that it would not
detect C<freeze> protocol upgrades, instead reverting to pre-1.15
behaviour.

C<Set::Object> 1.16 and above are capable of dealing correctly with
all serialized forms, as well as correctly aborting if a "newer"
C<freeze> protocol is detected during C<thaw>.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

The following benchmark compares C<Set::Object> with using a hash to
emulate a set-like collection (this is an old benchmark, but still
holds true):

   use Set::Object;

   package Obj;
   sub new { bless { } }

   @els = map { Obj->new() } 1..1000;

   require Benchmark;

   Benchmark::timethese(100, {
      'Control' => sub { },
      'H insert' => sub { my %h = (); @h{@els} = @els; },
      'S insert' => sub { my $s = Set::Object->new(); $s->insert(@els) },
      } );

   %gh = ();
   @gh{@els} = @els;

   $gs = Set::Object->new(@els);
   $el = $els[33];

   Benchmark::timethese(100_000, {
	   'H lookup' => sub { exists $gh{33} },
	   'S lookup' => sub { $gs->includes($el) }
      } );

On my computer the results are:

   Benchmark: timing 100 iterations of Control, H insert, S insert...
      Control:  0 secs ( 0.01 usr  0.00 sys =  0.01 cpu)
               (warning: too few iterations for a reliable count)
     H insert: 68 secs (67.81 usr  0.00 sys = 67.81 cpu)
     S insert:  9 secs ( 8.81 usr  0.00 sys =  8.81 cpu)
   Benchmark: timing 100000 iterations of H lookup, S lookup...
     H lookup:  7 secs ( 7.14 usr  0.00 sys =  7.14 cpu)
     S lookup:  6 secs ( 5.94 usr  0.00 sys =  5.94 cpu)

=head1 THREAD SAFETY

This module has none.
