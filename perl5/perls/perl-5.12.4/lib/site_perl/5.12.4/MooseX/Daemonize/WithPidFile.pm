=head1 NAME

MooseX::Daemonize::WithPidFile - A Role with the core daemonization and pidfile management

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package My::Daemon;
  use Moose;

  with 'MooseX::Daemonize::WithPidFile';

  sub start {
      my $self = shift;
      # daemonize me ...
      $self->daemonize; # << this will write the pidfile for you
      # return from the parent,...
      return unless $self->is_daemon;
      # but continue on in the child (daemon)
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a slightly extended basic daemonization Role, it provides
Pidfile management along with the core daemonization features
found in L<MooseX::Daemonize::Core>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item I<pidfile (is => rw, isa => MooseX::Daemonize::Pid::File)>

This attribute holds the L<MooseX::Daemonize::Pid::File> object used
to manage the Pidfile. It will initialize the object using the
C<init_pidfile> method (which is required by this role).

=back

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=over 4

=item I<init_pidfile>

This method is used to build the I<pidfile> attribute's object. It should
return a L<MooseX::Daemonize::Pid::File> object.

=item B<has_pidfile>

This is a predicate method to tell you if your I<pidfile> attribute has
been initialized yet.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<daemonize>

This adds an C<after> method modifier to the C<daemonize> method (from
L<MooseX::Daemonize::Core>) and handles writing your Pidfile for you.

=item B<meta>

The C<meta()> method from L<Class::MOP::Class>

=back

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<Moose::Role>, L<MooseX::Getopt> and L<MooseX::Daemonize::Pid::File>

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
