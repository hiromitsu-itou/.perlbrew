=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Action::Deserialize - Deserialize Data in a Request

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Foo::Controller::Bar;

    __PACKAGE__->config(
        'default'   => 'text/x-yaml',
        'stash_key' => 'rest',
        'map'       => {
            'text/x-yaml'        => 'YAML',
            'text/x-data-dumper' => [ 'Data::Serializer', 'Data::Dumper' ],
        },
    );

    sub begin :ActionClass('Deserialize') {}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This action will deserialize HTTP POST, PUT, OPTIONS and DELETE requests.
It assumes that the body of the HTTP Request is a serialized object.
The serializer is selected by introspecting the requests content-type
header.

If you want deserialize any other HTTP method besides POST, PUT,
OPTIONS and DELETE you can do this by setting the
C<< deserialize_http_methods >> list via C<< action_args >>.
Just modify the config in your controller and define a list of HTTP
methods the deserialization should happen for:

    __PACKAGE__->config(
        action_args => {
            '*' => {
                deserialize_http_methods => [qw(POST PUT OPTIONS DELETE GET)]
            }
        }
    );

See also L<Catalyst::Controller/action_args>.

The specifics of deserializing each content-type is implemented as
a plugin to L<Catalyst::Action::Deserialize>.  You can see a list
of currently implemented plugins in L<Catalyst::Controller::REST>.

The results of your Deserializing will wind up in $c->req->data.
This is done through the magic of L<Catalyst::Request::REST>.

While it is common for this Action to be called globally as a
C<begin> method, there is nothing stopping you from using it on a
single routine:

   sub foo :Local :Action('Deserialize') {}

Will work just fine.

When you use this module, the request class will be changed to
L<Catalyst::Request::REST>.

You likely want to look at L<Catalyst::Controller::REST>, which implements
a sensible set of defaults for a controller doing REST.
