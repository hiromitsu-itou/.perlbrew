Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::lighttpd::FastCGI - Deploying Catalyst with lighttpd

=head1 Lighttpd

These configurations were tested with Lighttpd 1.4.7.

=head2 Standalone server mode

    server.document-root = "/var/www/MyApp/root"

    fastcgi.server = (
        "" => (
            "MyApp" => (
                "socket"      => "/tmp/myapp.socket",
                "check-local" => "disable"
            )
        )
    )

=head2 Static mode

    server.document-root = "/var/www/MyApp/root"

    fastcgi.server = (
        "" => (
            "MyApp" => (
                "socket"       => "/tmp/myapp.socket",
                "check-local"  => "disable",
                "bin-path"     => "/var/www/MyApp/script/myapp_fastcgi.pl",
                "min-procs"    => 2,
                "max-procs"    => 5,
                "idle-timeout" => 20
            )
        )
    )

Note that in newer versions of lighttpd, the min-procs and idle-timeout
values are disabled.  The above example would start 5 processes.

=head2 Non-root configuration

You can also run your application at any non-root location with either of the
above modes.  Note the required mod_rewrite rule.

    url.rewrite = ( "myapp\$" => "myapp/" )
    fastcgi.server = (
        "/myapp" => (
            "MyApp" => (
                # same as above
            )
        )
    )

=head2 Static file handling

Static files can be served directly by lighttpd for a performance boost.

   $HTTP["url"] !~ "^/(?:img/|static/|css/|favicon.ico$)" {
         fastcgi.server = (
             "" => (
                 "MyApp" => (
                     "socket"       => "/tmp/myapp.socket",
                     "check-local"  => "disable",
                 )
             )
         )
    }

This will serve everything in the C<img>, C<static>, and C<css>
directories statically, as well as the favicon file.
