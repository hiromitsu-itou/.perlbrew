Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::nginx::FastCGI - Deploying Catalyst with nginx

=head1 nginx

Catalyst runs under nginx via FastCGI in a similar fashion as the lighttpd
standalone server.

nginx does not have its own internal FastCGI process manager, so you must run
the FastCGI service separately.

=head2 Configuration

To configure nginx, you must configure the FastCGI parameters and also the
socket your FastCGI daemon is listening on.  It can be either a TCP socket
or a Unix file socket.

The server configuration block should look roughly like:

    server {
        listen $port;

        location / {
            fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string;
            fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method;
            fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type;
            fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH     $content_length;

            fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_NAME        /;
            fastcgi_param  PATH_INFO          $fastcgi_script_name;
            fastcgi_param  REQUEST_URI        $request_uri;
            fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_URI       $document_uri;
            fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_ROOT      $document_root;
            fastcgi_param  SERVER_PROTOCOL    $server_protocol;

            fastcgi_param  GATEWAY_INTERFACE  CGI/1.1;
            fastcgi_param  SERVER_SOFTWARE    nginx/$nginx_version;

            fastcgi_param  REMOTE_ADDR        $remote_addr;
            fastcgi_param  REMOTE_PORT        $remote_port;
            fastcgi_param  SERVER_ADDR        $server_addr;
            fastcgi_param  SERVER_PORT        $server_port;
            fastcgi_param  SERVER_NAME        $server_name;
        
            # Adjust the socket for your applications!
            fastcgi_pass   unix:$docroot/myapp.socket;
        }
    }

It is the standard convention of nginx to include the fastcgi_params in a
separate file (usually something like C</etc/nginx/fastcgi_params>) and
simply include that file.

=head2  Non-root configuration

If you properly specify the PATH_INFO and SCRIPT_NAME parameters your
application will be accessible at any path. The SCRIPT_NAME variable is the
prefix of your application, and PATH_INFO would be everything in addition.

As an example, if your application is rooted at /myapp, you would configure:

    fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_NAME /myapp/;
    fastcgi_param  PATH_INFO   $fastcgi_script_name;

C<$fastcgi_script_name> would be "/myapp/path/of/the/action".  Catalyst will
process this accordingly and setup the application base as expected.

This behavior is somewhat different from Apache and lighttpd, but is still
functional.
