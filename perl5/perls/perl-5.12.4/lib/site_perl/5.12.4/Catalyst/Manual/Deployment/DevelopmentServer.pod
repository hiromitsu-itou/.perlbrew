Catalyst::Manual::DevelopmentServer - Development server deployment

The development server is a mini web server written in Perl. However, if
you supply the C<-f> option to the development server, it will load the
higher performance L<Starman> server, which can be used as an
application server with a lightweight proxy web server at the front.

=head1 Setup

=head2 Start up the development server

   script/myapp_server.pl -p 8080 -k -f --pidfile=/tmp/myapp.pid

You will probably want to write an init script to handle stop/starting
the app using the pid file.

=head2 Configuring Apache

Make sure mod_proxy is enabled and add:

    # Serve static content directly
    DocumentRoot /var/www/MyApp/root
    Alias /static /var/www/MyApp/root/static

    ProxyRequests Off
    <Proxy *>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Proxy>

    # Need to specifically stop these paths from being passed to proxy
    ProxyPass /static !
    ProxyPass /favicon.ico !

    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

    # This is optional if you'd like to show a custom error page
    # if the proxy is not available
    ErrorDocument 502 /static/error_pages/http502.html

You can wrap the above within a VirtualHost container if you want
different apps served on the same host.

=head2 Other web servers

The proxy configuration above can also be replicated with a different
frontend server or proxy, such as varnish, nginx, or lighttpd.
